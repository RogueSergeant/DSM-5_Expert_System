Patient states, \"I replay meetings in my head and worry about every detail for days,\" and \"I go to bed exhausted but my mind won't shut off.\" Worry occurs more days than not, is difficult for the patient to control, and focuses on fear of making mistakes, being judged, and minor logistic problems (e.g., missing deadlines, being late to meetings).

DEMOGRAPHICS AND CHIEF COMPLAINT\n3-year-old child brought by mother who reports \"He is different since the house incident\u2014he won't stop replaying it\" and \"He has bad dreams and won't sleep without me.\"\n\n2. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nMother reports symptoms began approximately 1 month ago after an acute household incident in early December 2025. \"He saw us get hurt and then he learned that I was hurt too,\" mother states. Caregiver describes frequent repetitive play that reenacts the event, repeated verbalizations of brief phrases heard during the incident, and sudden freezing episodes. \"He will suddenly stop and stare, then put the toys in the same pattern over and over,\" and \"Some nights he screams in his sleep and wakes up crying but won't tell me why.\" Mother reports increased clinginess, multiple daily intense temper outbursts with hitting and throwing objects, and refusal to go to the familiar backyard or the car where the incident occurred. Eating has decreased; there is nighttime waking requiring caregiver soothing. Toileting had been toilet-trained but there have been a few daytime accidents over the past 2 weeks. No prior similar episodes.\n\n3. DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY\nWalked at 12 months, uses multiword phrases and vocabulary appropriate for age, follows simple directions, independent with most self-care for age. No prior developmental evaluations. Language and motor development reported as developmentally appropriate.\n\n4. FAMILY HISTORY\nMother reports a history of mental health treatment in a first-degree relative; father reports no known history.\n\n5. MEDICAL HISTORY\nFull-term vaginal birth without complications. No chronic medical conditions. No current prescriptions; uses occasional acetaminophen for minor illnesses. Recent upper respiratory infection resolved 3 weeks ago. Substance use: mother reports drinks alcohol socially (1\u20132 times/month), no recreational drug use in caregivers, minimal caffeine use. Labs: TSH normal, metabolic panel unremarkable, toxicology negative.\n\nPertinent negatives: Caregiver denies child talking about wanting to die or harm self; caregiver denies intentionally hurting others beyond temper outbursts; caregiver denies loss of previously acquired language.\n\n6. BEHAVIOURAL OBSERVATIONS / MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION\nChild appeared disheveled but physically well groomed for age; clung to mother on arrival, required permitting mother to remain in room. Eye contact intermittent; engaged in play but repeatedly reenacted a specific event with toy figures, lining them up and making repetitive noises. Affect tearful at times, flat during reenactment play, fearful when approached toward the door. Play was constricted and repetitive, centered on the incident; no spontaneous imaginative play observed. Startle response exaggerated to loud noises. Separation from caregiver produced crying and refusal to cooperate with brief tasks. Speech age-appropriate in vocabulary but often limited to short repetitive phrases referencing the event. Motor activity hypervigilant with scanning the room. Attention fluctuated with easy distractibility. Sleep disrupted per caregiver; appetite decreased; brief regression in toileting noted.\n\nDURATION: Symptoms present for approximately 1 month, beginning early December 2025.\n\nFUNCTIONAL IMPACT\nRelationships: Increased clinginess with mother, irritability toward father and sibling during play, frequent conflicts at home. Peer/play: Withdrawn from parallel play, limited reciprocal play, obsessions with reenactment interfere with play with peers. Preschool/home routines: Refusal to enter car or backyard, difficulty participating in routine activities, frequent disruptions to family schedule. Sleep/eating/toileting: Frequent night awakenings with screaming, decreased appetite, recent daytime toileting accidents.",

DEMOGRAPHICS AND CHIEF COMPLAINT\n5-year-old child brought by mother who reports \"He won't stop acting like the night we were at the hospital\" and \"He screams and throws things for no reason.\"\n\n2. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nMother reports child was present and witnessed an incident in which she was injured at home approximately 1 month ago. \"He saw me on the floor and keeps playing that same scene with his toys,\" she states. Mother describes increased frequency of upset, fear, and shame: \"He looks scared for no reason and cries when he hears loud noises.\" Timeline: symptoms began about one month ago, shortly after the event. Child's play has shifted from simple pretend to repetitive reenactment of the incident (placing dolls in hurt positions, making siren noises). Sleep has become fragmented; mother notes frequent nights waking and reports \"he says he had bad dreams\" but cannot provide specific content. Appetite mildly decreased; occasional toileting accidents over past two weeks after being consistently dry. Attachment has changed \u2014 increased clinginess, refusing brief separations at preschool and at home. Emotional regulation impaired with frequent, intense temper outbursts (yelling, hitting walls, throwing toys) several times per week.\n\nCaregiver denies that the child directly experienced the event in the sense of being physically harmed. Caregiver denies that the child was only told about the event happening to a caregiver rather than witnessing it. Caregiver denies knowledge of recurrent distressing dreams with clear content linked to the incident. Caregiver denies observed episodes in which the child appears to lose touch with the present (no dissociative-like episodes reported). Caregiver denies intense or prolonged distress when exposed to reminders observed at home. Caregiver denies marked physical reactions (e.g., fainting, vomiting) to reminders. Caregiver denies a persistent pattern of avoiding all activities or places because of the event, though child has begun refusing specific situations.\n\n3. DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY\nWalked at ~12 months, first words around 12 months, combining words by 2 years. No prior developmental evaluations; caregiver reports age-appropriate gross motor skills.\n\n4. FAMILY HISTORY\nMother reports prior treatment for episodic low mood; father no known mental health treatment.\n\n5. MEDICAL HISTORY\nFull-term birth, uncomplicated. No chronic medical conditions. No current prescription medications; occasional acetaminophen as needed. Substance use in household: mother drinks alcohol socially (1\u20132 drinks/week), no recreational drug use reported, limited caffeine. Labs: TSH normal, metabolic panel unremarkable, toxicology negative.\n\n6. BEHAVIOURAL OBSERVATIONS / MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION\nWell-groomed, age-appropriate dress. During play, child repeatedly reenacted hurt/medical scenes with dolls, used loud siren noises, and returned to theme despite redirection. Made intermittent eye contact, often looked toward mother for reassurance. Affect variable: tearful and fearful when discussing loud noises, flat when asked about friends. Play was repetitive and thematically focused on injury; limited spontaneous imaginative play. Demonstrated clinginess, resisted brief separation from mother. Startle to a sudden door slam was exaggerated. Language fluent for age, sentences intact; fine and gross motor skills developmentally appropriate. No self-injurious behavior observed. Social interest toward examiner present but play with peers at preschool reportedly decreased.",
