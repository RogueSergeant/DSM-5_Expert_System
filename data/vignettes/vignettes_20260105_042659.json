HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\nPatient reports onset approximately one month ago, beginning in early December 2025, after learning that her close friend was killed in a car crash. She states, \"I was told on the phone and it just felt unreal,\" and later reports, \"I don't really remember exactly what happened around that call \u2014 there's a blank.\" Patient describes recurrent distressing dreams several times per week in which she is back at the roadside scene; dreams evoke intense fear and sadness and wake her up. She endorses active efforts to avoid thinking about the event: \"I try not to scroll through his pictures or talk about him, I kind of close the tab.\" Patient reports persistent inability to feel positive emotions toward usual activities or relationships, saying, \"things that used to make me happy just feel muted, like I'm watching from far away.\" She describes increased irritability and several angry outbursts over the last month, including yelling at coworkers and once throwing a mug.
