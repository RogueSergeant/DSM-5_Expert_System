Multiple inattentive symptoms (overlooking details, difficulty sustaining attention, failure to follow through on tasks, procrastination/avoidance of lengthy tasks, losing items) and multiple hyperactive/impulsive symptoms (leaving seat, difficulty remaining quiet, talking/excessive interruptions, blurting answers) are present \u2014 consistent with combined presentation. Symptoms occur in work and daily life (\u22652 settings). Other disorders considered (MDD, GAD, PTSD, ASD) are not supported by the history/exam (no persistent depressed mood or anhedonia, no pervasive excessive worry meeting GAD criteria, no trauma history for PTSD, no early pervasive social-communication deficits or restrictive/repetitive behaviors for ASD)."
