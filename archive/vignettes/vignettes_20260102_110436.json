    "clinical_text": "A 34-year-old elementary school teacher presents for evaluation of worsening mood and functioning over the past 6 weeks. She reports feeling \"down and empty nearly all day, every day\" and says she has \"lost interest in everything,\" including reading, cooking, and playing with her child. She describes a marked drop in energy: \"I feel exhausted from the moment I wake up.\" She endorses poor sleep with both difficulty falling asleep and frequent early-morning awakenings, averaging 4\u20135 hours nightly. Over the same period, she has had decreased appetite with an unintentional 10-pound weight loss, stating food \"tastes like nothing\" and she often skips meals.\n\nShe reports difficulty concentrating at work, making uncharacteristic mistakes when grading and needing to re-read emails multiple times. She feels slowed down and notes coworkers have asked if she is \"okay\" because she moves and speaks more slowly than usual. She endorses excessive guilt and feelings of worthlessness: \"I\u2019m a terrible mother and a terrible teacher. Everyone would be better off if I wasn\u2019t around.\" She describes frequent tearfulness and social withdrawal, avoiding friends and family calls because \"it takes too much effort.\" Symptoms have caused significant impairment: she has taken multiple sick days, struggles to complete lesson planning, and reports tension at home due to her inability to participate in routine activities.\n\nShe endorses recurrent thoughts of death and passive suicidal ideation, stating, \"I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up,\" and admits to thinking about \"taking a bunch of pills\" but denies collecting medications, writing a note, or taking steps toward an attempt. She denies any history of suicide attempts. She denies current or past episodes of abnormally elevated or expansive mood, decreased need for sleep with high energy, pressured speech, inflated self-esteem, impulsive spending, or other periods of increased goal-directed activity suggestive of mania or hypomania. She denies hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia. There is no recent alcohol or drug use; she drinks coffee daily and reports rare alcohol intake (1\u20132 drinks per month). She is not taking steroids or other medications associated with mood changes.\n\nPast psychiatric history is notable for one prior similar episode in her early 20s that lasted several months and improved with counseling; she has never been psychiatrically hospitalized. Family history includes a mother with recurrent episodes of severe low mood treated with antidepressant medication. Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable; she denies fever, heat/cold intolerance, and neurologic symptoms. She reports regular menses and is not currently pregnant or postpartum. On mental status examination, she is appropriately dressed with reduced eye contact, slowed psychomotor activity, and soft, slowed speech. Mood is \"depressed\" with constricted affect. Thought process is linear. Thought content is notable for hopelessness and passive suicidal ideation without current intent; she agrees to safety planning and to seek emergency help if urges escalate. Cognition is grossly intact, though attention appears diminished during the interview. Insight and judgment are fair.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. R is a 34-year-old project coordinator who presents for evaluation due to persistent, hard-to-control worry and tension that she describes as \"my mind never shuts off.\" She reports that for the past 9\u201310 months she has been worrying \"most days, from the moment I wake up\" about multiple areas: making mistakes at work and being blamed for delays, her child\u2019s safety (e.g., checking weather and traffic repeatedly before school pickup), her parents\u2019 health overseas, finances despite stable income, and her own health after intermittent gastrointestinal discomfort. She states, \"Even when one thing gets resolved, my brain finds a new problem,\" and she finds it difficult to stop or postpone the worrying once it starts.\n\nShe describes associated physical and cognitive symptoms occurring on most days over the same period: feeling \"keyed up\" and unable to relax, frequent muscle tightness in her neck and shoulders, fatigue by late afternoon, and irritability that she notices \"snapping at my husband over tiny things.\" She reports difficulty concentrating at work, saying she rereads emails \"three times\" and worries she has missed something. Sleep has been disrupted with trouble falling asleep due to rumination and waking around 3\u20134 a.m. thinking about work tasks; she averages 5\u20136 hours of sleep and feels unrefreshed.\n\nShe notes increased reassurance-seeking and checking behaviors that she views as attempts to manage worry rather than as rituals with magical thinking. For example, she checks her work calendar and phone notifications repeatedly and asks her supervisor, \"Are you sure this is okay?\" She acknowledges that these behaviors are excessive and time-consuming, contributing to reduced productivity and longer work hours. At home she feels less present with her child, stating, \"I\u2019m physically there, but my brain is running scenarios.\" She denies avoidance of specific places due to fear of panic, and denies discrete episodes of sudden terror with abrupt onset peaking within minutes; however, she occasionally experiences brief surges of palpitations and shortness of breath when she feels behind at work, which she attributes to \"being overwhelmed\" and which resolve when she steps away.\n\nMedical history is notable for intermittent abdominal cramping and alternating constipation/loose stools that worsen during stressful periods; she has seen her primary care clinician and had basic labs that were normal, and she was advised dietary changes. She denies weight loss, fever, or blood in stool. She denies thyroid disease. She is not pregnant. She takes no regular medications other than occasional ibuprofen; she denies stimulant use. She drinks alcohol socially (1\u20132 drinks on weekends) and denies cannabis or other substances.\n\nPsychiatric history: no prior psychiatric hospitalizations. She reports a lifelong tendency to be \"a worrier,\" but says symptoms became significantly worse after a reorganization at work and increased childcare demands. She denies current or past episodes of persistently elevated mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, or impulsive risk-taking. She endorses intermittent low mood and guilt about \"not handling it better\" but denies anhedonia most days, marked appetite change, or suicidal ideation. She denies intrusive memories, nightmares, or avoidance related to trauma. She denies obsessive intrusive thoughts that feel alien or accompanied by rigid compulsions; she frames her checking as worry-driven.\n\nMental status exam: well-groomed, cooperative; psychomotor mildly tense with fidgeting. Speech normal rate/volume. Mood described as \"anxious and exhausted\"; affect anxious, constricted but reactive. Thought process linear, occasionally overinclusive when discussing worries. Thought content notable for excessive anticipatory worry about multiple domains; no delusions; no perceptual disturbances. Cognition grossly intact; attention mildly impaired by distraction. Insight fair; judgment intact.\n\nRisk: She denies suicidal or homicidal ideation, intent, or plan. No history of self-harm. Protective factors include strong family connection and engagement in care.\n\nOverall, her symptoms have been present more days than not for over six months, are difficult to control, and are associated with restlessness, fatigue, concentration problems, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance, causing clinically significant impairment at work and in family functioning. There is no evidence that symptoms are attributable to a substance, medication, or another medical condition based on available history, though she is willing to coordinate with primary care if further evaluation is needed.",

    "demographics": "29-year-old woman, software engineer at a mid-size tech company, primarily remote work; lives with partner; college graduate.",
    "clinical_text": "Ms. R is a 29-year-old software engineer who presents for evaluation due to longstanding difficulties with attention, organization, and follow-through that have become more impairing after a recent promotion requiring more self-directed project management. She reports, \u201cIf someone is sitting next to me, I can crank things out. If I\u2019m on my own, I\u2019ll stare at the screen, then somehow an hour is gone.\u201d She describes chronic procrastination, starting tasks close to deadlines, and then working in intense \u201call-nighter\u201d bursts to catch up. She frequently loses track of details in longer assignments, misses steps in multi-part workflows, and makes \u201ccareless mistakes\u201d in code reviews (e.g., forgetting to update a parameter or overlooking a small but critical dependency).\n\nInattention symptoms are prominent across settings. At work, she struggles to sustain focus in virtual meetings, stating, \u201cI\u2019m listening\u2026 and then I realize I haven\u2019t heard the last five minutes.\u201d She often needs colleagues to repeat action items and relies heavily on reminders and sticky notes. Despite these strategies, she misplaces essential items (security key fob, earbuds, charger), forgets appointments unless they are immediately calendared, and has difficulty prioritizing tasks when multiple requests arrive at once. She endorses distractibility by external stimuli (notifications, background noises) and internal distractions (\u201cmy mind jumps to three other things I should be doing\u201d). At home, she reports unfinished projects (laundry left mid-cycle, half-cleaned kitchen), difficulty maintaining a consistent routine, and chronic clutter. Her partner complains she \u201cdoesn\u2019t follow through\u201d and seems \u201cnot fully present\u201d during conversations; she acknowledges zoning out and needing frequent prompts.\n\nShe also describes a persistent sense of restlessness: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m always revving.\u201d During meetings she fidgets, taps her foot, and changes sitting positions frequently. She finds it difficult to relax in the evenings unless she is doing something with her hands. She interrupts at times, finishing others\u2019 sentences when excited, and reports impatience in queues and while waiting for responses (\u201cI send a message and then check every two minutes\u201d). She denies frequent yelling or physical aggression, but notes occasional impulsive online purchases and difficulty resisting checking her phone while working.\n\nDevelopmental history supports early onset. She recalls similar patterns in elementary school: \u201cMy desk was a disaster,\u201d frequent forgotten homework, and being told she was \u201cbright but not applying herself.\u201d Old report cards (per patient recollection) included comments about daydreaming, talking in class, and rushing through assignments. She states she could focus for long periods on highly interesting activities (e.g., drawing, video games, later coding), but struggled with routine tasks and reading assignments unless there was an imminent deadline. Symptoms were present at home and school, with recurrent conflicts over chores and morning routines.\n\nFunctional impact is clinically significant. At work she has received feedback about missed details, uneven productivity, and late deliverables despite strong technical skill. She reports chronic stress about \u201calways being behind\u201d and fears job consequences. At home, she and her partner argue about shared responsibilities and her tendency to forget planned activities. She reports two minor car accidents in her early 20s attributed to inattention and has had multiple speeding tickets related to impatience, though she denies driving under the influence.\n\nComorbidity/non-standard features: She reports mild generalized worry largely secondary to performance issues (\u201cI\u2019m anxious because I don\u2019t trust myself to get things done\u201d). She describes variable sleep with difficulty initiating sleep when her mind is \u201cspinning,\u201d often staying up late scrolling or starting new tasks. She uses caffeine daily (3\u20134 cups of coffee) to \u201cget going\u201d and reports occasional cannabis edibles on weekends, denying escalation, withdrawal, or functional impairment related to substances. She denies current or past episodes consistent with mania/hypomania (no sustained decreased need for sleep with elevated mood, grandiosity, or increased goal-directed activity beyond baseline), denies persistent depressive symptoms, and denies psychotic symptoms. There is no history of traumatic brain injury. Medical review is unremarkable aside from intermittent tension headaches.\n\nOn mental status examination (as observed in this simulation), she is cooperative and engaged, with rapid but coherent speech at times. Mood is \u201cstressed,\u201d affect congruent. Thought process is logical though occasionally tangential when describing multiple examples. She frequently shifts posture and fidgets. Attention during the interview is variably sustained; she asks for one question to be repeated after becoming distracted by a notification. Insight is fair; judgment is generally intact.\n\nOverall, she presents with a persistent pattern of inattention with associated restlessness/impulsivity beginning in childhood, present across academic/work and home settings, and causing meaningful impairment. Her anxiety appears largely reactive to chronic disorganization and inconsistent task completion rather than a primary mood disorder.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. A is a 34-year-old project coordinator referred by her primary care clinician for persistent anxiety, sleep disruption, and worsening work performance. She reports that 11 months ago she was involved in a serious motor vehicle collision while driving home from work. She describes being trapped briefly in the car with the smell of gasoline and hearing \u201cmetal crunching and people yelling.\u201d She believed she might die until first responders arrived. She sustained minor physical injuries but no loss of consciousness.\n\nSince the collision, she reports recurrent, unwanted memories that \u201cbarge in like a replay\u201d several times per week, often triggered by screeching brakes, the smell of fuel, or driving past the intersection where it occurred. She endorses occasional vivid dreams with similar themes (\u201cI wake up convinced it\u2019s happening again\u201d) and describes episodes while driving in which she \u201czones out and suddenly I\u2019m back there,\u201d gripping the steering wheel, heart racing, and feeling detached from the present. She avoids driving on highways, refuses to drive at night, and takes longer routes to avoid the crash site. She has also stopped watching news clips or movies involving accidents, stating, \u201cI can\u2019t handle it\u2014I\u2019ll spiral.\u201d\n\nShe reports a persistent change in mood and thinking since the event. She describes frequent guilt (\u201cIf I had left work five minutes earlier none of this would have happened\u201d), increased irritability, and feeling emotionally numb at home: \u201cMy husband is talking and I\u2019m there, but I\u2019m not there.\u201d She reports diminished interest in social activities and has declined invitations from friends because crowded restaurants make her feel \u201con edge.\u201d She describes a reduced sense of safety and ongoing negative expectations: \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for something bad to happen.\u201d She notes she is more detached from her spouse and has less patience with her child, which she finds distressing.\n\nShe describes chronic hypervigilance, especially in traffic and public places: \u201cI\u2019m always scanning\u2014who\u2019s coming up behind me, where are the exits.\u201d She startles easily at sudden noises. Sleep is disrupted by difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and occasional nightmares; she averages 4\u20135 hours nightly and feels exhausted. She reports increased irritability and occasional verbal outbursts at work, which is new for her.\n\nHer primary concern in the past 6 months has been impaired concentration and restlessness at work. She states, \u201cI can\u2019t focus like I used to. I start an email and then I\u2019m staring at the screen.\u201d She has missed deadlines, forgotten meetings, and struggles to follow multi-step instructions when under stress. Coworkers have commented that she seems \u201cscattered.\u201d She worries she may have an attention disorder because she fidgets, taps her foot during meetings, and feels driven to stay busy. However, she reports she was consistently organized and academically successful throughout childhood and college, denies longstanding problems with attention or impulsivity, and states these difficulties began only after the collision. She reports that on days with poor sleep or when she has to drive, her concentration is markedly worse; on calmer days or when working from home, she can complete tasks closer to her baseline. She denies a history of school disciplinary issues, chronic forgetfulness across childhood, or longstanding difficulty sustaining attention in non-stressful settings.\n\nShe denies current or past manic symptoms (no episodes of decreased need for sleep with elevated or expansive mood, pressured speech, or risky behavior). She denies psychotic symptoms. She denies current substance use disorder; she drinks alcohol 1\u20132 drinks on weekends and denies using alcohol to cope, though she sometimes has a glass of wine to \u201ctry to shut my brain off.\u201d She denies suicidal intent or plan but endorses passive thoughts during high-stress nights (\u201cI wish I could just not wake up\u201d) without preparatory behaviors; protective factors include her child and spouse. \n\nSymptoms have persisted for nearly a year and cause significant impairment: she avoids necessary driving, has reduced productivity at work with performance warnings, and reports strain in relationships. On mental status examination, she is alert and oriented, cooperative, with anxious affect and frequent scanning of the room during loud hallway noises. Thought process is linear but becomes circumstantial when discussing the collision. Attention is variable during the interview; she becomes markedly distracted when hearing a car horn outside and visibly tenses. Insight is fair; judgment is intact. She requests help with sleep, driving anxiety, and \u201cgetting my focus back.\u201d",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \u201cPeople keep telling me I\u2019m scattered and rude, but I\u2019m trying really hard.\u201d\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient was referred by her primary care clinician after escalating workplace conflict and a recent negative performance review citing \u201cmissed context in meetings,\u201d \u201crigidity,\u201d and \u201cdifficulty collaborating.\u201d She reports increasing fatigue and irritability after days with frequent meetings, open-office noise, or abrupt task switching. She describes being able to focus for long periods when working alone on structured tasks (\u201cI can do test cases for six hours straight and forget to eat\u201d), but becoming overwhelmed when requirements are ambiguous or when she must interpret indirect feedback. She says, \u201cIf someone hints, I don\u2019t know what they want. I need them to say it.\u201d\n\nShe endorses occasional forgetfulness (misplacing badge/keys, missing a calendar change) and being \u201cmentally blank\u201d during group discussions, which prompted an outside suggestion that she \u201cmight have attention problems.\u201d However, she denies a longstanding pattern of impulsive behavior, risk-taking, or frequent careless errors across settings. She reports that attention lapses occur disproportionately in loud, socially complex environments or when multiple people talk at once. She can sustain attention during quiet reading, coding, and even lengthy administrative tasks if she can complete them sequentially with clear steps. She uses elaborate external systems (color-coded checklists, timers, scripted email templates) and becomes distressed when others deviate from agreed workflows. \u201cIf the plan changes last minute, I feel like my brain locks. I can still do it, but it takes me hours to recover.\u201d\n\nSocial communication history: She describes lifelong difficulty with reciprocal conversation and interpreting social nuance. She reports that as a child she preferred solitary play and \u201corganizing my toy animals by species and size\u201d rather than pretend play with peers. She recalls being told she was \u201ctoo intense\u201d and \u201ctalked like a little professor.\u201d Currently, she reports that in conversations she often misses when others are bored or want to change topics; she may continue speaking about a topic of interest despite cues. She experiences difficulty with back-and-forth small talk and says she relies on learned scripts: \u201cI have a list in my head\u2014ask about their weekend, then mirror their answer.\u201d She reports uncertainty about tone and facial expressions: \u201cI can read obvious stuff, but subtle sarcasm goes right over my head.\u201d She describes long-standing challenges making and maintaining friendships; she has one close friend she sees monthly and prefers relationships based on shared activities rather than unstructured socializing. She reports that colleagues have called her \u201cblunt,\u201d though she does not intend to offend and is often confused afterward about what went wrong.\n\nNonverbal communication and interaction: In the interview, her speech is fluent and formal with occasional pedantic phrasing. Eye contact is inconsistent\u2014she alternates between sustained staring when emphasizing a point and looking away for long stretches when listening. She reports consciously managing eye contact: \u201cIf I look at their eyes, I can\u2019t process the words.\u201d She demonstrates limited use of gestures and describes difficulty knowing what to do with her hands during conversation. She reports discomfort with hugs and prefers predictable, brief greetings.\n\nRestricted/repetitive patterns and need for sameness: She describes strong preference for routines and distress with unexpected change. She eats the same breakfast daily and becomes preoccupied if her usual brand is unavailable. She reports repetitive behaviors under stress: finger rubbing, rocking subtly when seated alone, and repeating phrases quietly to herself to \u201creset.\u201d She describes intense, circumscribed interests since childhood, including a long-standing fascination with public transit maps and train schedules; she spends hours making detailed route spreadsheets \u201cfor fun\u201d and becomes animated when discussing minor service changes. She acknowledges that this interest can dominate her time and conversations. She also reports collecting specific models of mechanical keyboards and becoming preoccupied with key-switch specifications.\n\nSensory features: She reports longstanding sensory sensitivities: fluorescent lights trigger headaches; certain clothing textures feel \u201clike sandpaper\u201d; she is highly sensitive to background noise and can hear \u201cevery keyboard click.\u201d She wears noise-canceling headphones at home and sometimes at work. She reports strong aversion to particular smells in the office kitchen, causing nausea. She describes sensory-seeking behaviors as well, including repetitive pressure on her hands and preference for weighted blankets. She notes that sensory overload can lead to shutdowns: \u201cIt\u2019s not a tantrum. My words just stop and I need to sit somewhere quiet.\u201d\n\nDevelopmental and educational history: Per patient and collateral from her mother (phone call with consent), early language milestones were within expected range but her speech was unusually advanced and overly formal. She was described as a \u201cquiet, intense\u201d child who played alone, had difficulty joining group games, and became upset when routines changed (e.g., substitute teachers). Teachers described her as academically strong, especially in math and reading, with high attention to detail. There was no consistent history of disruptive hyperactivity, classroom wandering, blurting, or chronic incomplete work. Mother reports that the patient could sustain attention for long periods on puzzles, books, and structured homework, and that any \u201cinattention\u201d tended to occur when she was overwhelmed by noise or social demands rather than across all contexts.\n\nOccupational functioning: She is technically competent and receives high marks for accuracy. Difficulties arise in collaborative settings: interpreting vague requirements, prioritizing when tasks are not explicitly sequenced, and coping with rapid changes. She reports spending excessive time perfecting documents because \u201cif there\u2019s an inconsistency, I can\u2019t let it go.\u201d She struggles with office politics and has been reprimanded for correcting colleagues publicly.\n\nMood/anxiety and sleep: She reports chronic anxiety related to social performance and unpredictability. She describes anticipatory worry before meetings and rumination afterward (\u201cI replay every sentence\u201d). She denies episodic elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, or grandiosity. Sleep onset insomnia is longstanding and worsens after overstimulating days. She denies current suicidal ideation, intent, or plan.\n\nADHD-focused review: She endorses occasional distractibility in noisy environments and difficulty switching tasks abruptly, but denies pervasive symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity across multiple settings since childhood. She denies frequent careless mistakes, chronic disorganization that predates workplace demands, impulsive spending, driving citations, or interrupting/blurting. Collateral does not support a childhood pattern of hyperactivity or broad-based inattentiveness; academic functioning was strong without behavioral complaints. Current difficulties appear closely linked to sensory overload, social-cognitive load, and rigidity around routines rather than a generalized attention regulation disorder.\n\nMental status exam (abridged): Well-groomed; cooperative but mildly tense. Speech normal rate/volume, formal tone. Mood \u201ctired\u201d; affect constricted but reactive when discussing interests. Thought process linear and detail-heavy. No hallucinations or delusions. Cognition grossly intact; attention adequate in the quiet interview room; becomes noticeably strained when asked to imagine unstructured social scenarios. Insight fair; judgment intact.\n\nSummary impression: Lifelong pattern of social reciprocity difficulties, challenges interpreting nonverbal cues and maintaining relationships, restricted and highly focused interests, insistence on sameness, repetitive self-soothing behaviors, and prominent sensory sensitivities with functional impairment in work and social domains. Symptoms present since early development per collateral and not better accounted for by psychosis, bipolar disorder, or a primary attention disorder; reported attention lapses are context-dependent and closely related to sensory and social demands.",

    "clinical_text": "34-year-old high school English teacher presents to outpatient psychiatry for evaluation of 6 weeks of progressively worsening mood symptoms. She reports feeling \"down and heavy\" nearly every day, most of the day, and says, \"I wake up already dreading everything.\" She also describes a marked loss of interest in activities she previously enjoyed (reading for pleasure, jogging, and spending time with friends): \"Nothing feels worth it, even the things I used to love.\"\n\nOver the same period, she endorses decreased appetite with an unintentional 10-pound weight loss in about a month, insomnia characterized by early-morning awakening (waking at 3\u20134 a.m. and unable to return to sleep), and low energy: \"By noon I feel like I\u2019ve run a marathon.\" Coworkers have commented she seems slowed down, and she agrees she has been moving and speaking more slowly in class, taking longer to grade papers. She reports poor concentration and indecisiveness: \"I reread the same paragraph five times and it won\u2019t stick,\" and she has made several minor mistakes at work, which is unusual for her.\n\nShe describes excessive guilt and feelings of worthlessness, stating, \"I\u2019m a terrible teacher and a terrible mom,\" despite reassurance from her spouse and no objective evidence of major performance problems. She denies any episodes in the past (or currently) of abnormally elevated or irritable mood, decreased need for sleep with high energy, pressured speech, racing thoughts, increased goal-directed activity, impulsive spending, or other symptoms suggestive of a manic or hypomanic episode.\n\nShe endorses recurrent thoughts that she would be \"better off not waking up\" and admits to passive suicidal ideation several times per week without a specific plan or intent. She denies past suicide attempts, current intent, access to firearms, or preparatory behaviors. Protective factors include commitment to her child, supportive spouse, and willingness to seek help; she agrees to a safety plan and to contact emergency services if suicidal thoughts intensify.\n\nSymptoms have caused clinically significant distress and impairment: she has taken two sick days in the past month (uncharacteristic), has stopped exercising, and has withdrawn socially. She denies alcohol or illicit drug use, and there is no recent medication change. Review of systems is negative for symptoms suggesting thyroid disease or other acute medical illness, and she denies recent postpartum period.

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \u201cMy brain won\u2019t shut off. I\u2019m constantly bracing for something to go wrong.\u201d\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient reports a long-standing tendency to \u201coverthink,\u201d but describes a clear worsening over the past 9\u201310 months, occurring on most days. She experiences persistent, difficult-to-control worry across multiple domains: work performance (missing deadlines, making mistakes), finances (unexpected expenses), health (minor aches interpreted as serious illness), and family safety (child getting hurt, spouse in an accident). She states, \u201cEven when things are fine, I\u2019m scanning for what I forgot or what could blow up.\u201d She notes that reassurance provides only brief relief and that she quickly shifts to a new worry.\n\nShe describes associated symptoms including feeling keyed up and restless (\u201clike an engine is revving\u201d), muscle tension in her neck/shoulders with frequent jaw clenching, irritability (\u201csnapping over small things\u201d), and significant sleep disturbance. Sleep onset is prolonged due to rumination; she often wakes early with worries and checks her phone/calendar. She reports daytime fatigue and a sense of being \u201cmentally drained,\u201d yet also \u201cwired.\u201d Concentration is inconsistent: she can focus when tasks are urgent or when she is calm, but during periods of worry she rereads emails repeatedly, loses her train of thought in meetings, and makes minor errors. She says, \u201cI\u2019ll open a document and suddenly I\u2019m thinking about whether the daycare forgot to lock the door.\u201d She also reports forgetfulness (misplacing keys, missing a non-urgent appointment), which she attributes to being preoccupied; she notes these lapses cluster on high-stress days.\n\nFunctional impact: Symptoms have led to reduced productivity and prolonged work hours to compensate for checking and rechecking. At home, she is more impatient with her child and avoids certain activities (e.g., driving in heavy traffic) due to feeling tense and distracted. She reports decreased enjoyment of previously relaxing activities because \u201cI can\u2019t relax without feeling guilty.\u201d\n\nCourse and context: She denies discrete episodes of sudden terror with palpitations and fear of dying; instead she describes a steady, ongoing apprehension. She denies intrusive images or rituals performed to neutralize thoughts; she does acknowledge frequent checking of calendars and messages but frames it as trying to manage worry rather than preventing a feared catastrophe through a specific rule-bound behavior. She denies avoidance driven primarily by fear of scrutiny; social interactions are generally comfortable, though she worries about disappointing others. She denies trauma-related nightmares, flashbacks, or hypervigilance tied to a specific traumatic event.\n\nMood and safety: She describes feeling \u201cstressed and worn down\u201d but denies persistent low mood most of the day nearly every day, anhedonia, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation. No history of manic or hypomanic periods; she denies decreased need for sleep with increased energy, pressured speech, or impulsive spending.\n\nAttention/developmental history (relevant to diagnostic challenge): She reports being an \u201cA/B student\u201d with no childhood history of chronic inattention, disruptive behavior, or academic impairment. She recalls being organized in school and able to finish homework without significant difficulty. She did not receive educational accommodations and denies longstanding issues across multiple childhood settings. She notes that her current attention and organization problems began in the context of escalating worry and increased responsibilities over the last year. She states, \u201cWhen I\u2019m on vacation or after a good night of sleep, I can focus fine.\u201d\n\nMedical/substance history: No known thyroid disease; no recent weight change, heat intolerance, or tremor. Denies stimulant use, over-the-counter weight-loss supplements, or excessive caffeine (typically 1\u20132 coffees; notes worse jitteriness if she has more). No current medications. No history of seizures or head injury.\n\nMental status exam (summary): Well-groomed, cooperative. Psychomotor activity mildly increased with fidgeting. Speech normal rate/volume. Affect anxious, congruent. Thought process linear but ruminative; thought content notable for excessive worry about multiple real-life domains. No delusions or hallucinations. Cognition grossly intact; attention mildly impaired during interview when discussing worries. Insight and judgment fair.\n\nClinical impression: Presentation is characterized by excessive, difficult-to-control worry occurring on most days for many months across multiple domains, accompanied by restlessness, fatigue, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance, and concentration difficulty, with meaningful occupational and interpersonal impairment. Inattention appears temporally linked to anxiety and not to a longstanding developmental pattern.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. R is a 28-year-old marketing coordinator who presents for evaluation due to longstanding difficulties with attention, organization, and restlessness that have caused persistent impairment at work and at home. She reports, \u201cMy brain feels like it\u2019s always jumping tracks,\u201d and describes frequent mistakes in routine tasks (e.g., sending emails with missing attachments, overlooking key details in campaign briefs) despite understanding the material. She notes she often starts tasks with good intentions but fails to finish them, stating, \u201cI\u2019ll open five tabs to work, then somehow I\u2019m reorganizing folders, checking messages, and the day\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nInattention symptoms are described as chronic and pervasive: she has difficulty sustaining attention during meetings (\u201cI drift off after a few minutes and realize I missed what was decided\u201d), frequently appears not to listen when spoken to directly (partner reports she \u201czones out\u201d mid-conversation), and struggles to follow through on instructions unless tasks are broken into small steps with reminders. She endorses significant organizational difficulty, including inconsistent use of calendars and to-do lists, misjudging time needed for tasks, and repeatedly missing deadlines unless prompted by supervisors. She avoids tasks that require prolonged mental effort (e.g., writing reports, budgeting), saying, \u201cI put it off until the last possible second because it feels unbearable to sit and focus.\u201d She frequently misplaces items (keys, badge, phone) and relies on \u201cfind my phone\u201d several times per week. She reports being easily distracted by external stimuli and her own thoughts, and she is forgetful in daily activities (forgetting to pay bills on time, missing appointments unless multiple alarms are set).\n\nShe also describes prominent hyperactive/impulsive features, experienced as inner restlessness and outward fidgeting. During the interview she shifts position often and taps her foot. She reports difficulty remaining seated through long meetings, frequently getting up to refill water or pace. Outside of work she finds it hard to relax, stating, \u201cEven when I\u2019m on the couch, my body wants to move.\u201d She talks excessively in social settings and sometimes speaks before thinking; she says, \u201cI blurt things out and then regret interrupting.\u201d She endorses difficulty waiting her turn (e.g., in lines, during group discussions) and regularly interrupts others or finishes their sentences. She reports occasional impulsive online purchases and switching hobbies quickly, though no high-risk behaviors are described.\n\nCourse and onset: She recalls symptoms beginning in elementary school, with teachers noting she was \u201cbright but daydreamy\u201d and frequently forgot homework. Her parents report she needed constant reminders, lost school supplies, and struggled to complete multi-step assignments. She describes needing to reread pages repeatedly and often being reprimanded for talking out of turn. Symptoms persisted through middle and high school; she relied on last-minute cramming and frequent all-nighters. In college she experienced similar difficulties and required extensions and study accommodations informally through supportive professors.\n\nPervasiveness and impairment: Symptoms occur across multiple settings (work, home, and social situations). At work she has received feedback about missed details, inconsistent follow-through, and time management issues despite strong creativity and motivation. At home, chores and shared responsibilities are a frequent source of conflict; she forgets agreed-upon tasks, leaves projects half-finished, and becomes overwhelmed by clutter. She reports significant distress and reduced self-confidence related to these persistent functional problems.\n\nShe denies current or past episodes consistent with mania or hypomania (no periods of abnormally elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, or goal-directed overactivity beyond her baseline). She reports mood as \u201cmostly okay,\u201d with frustration related to performance, but denies pervasive depressed mood, anhedonia, or suicidal ideation. She denies panic attacks, trauma-related symptoms, or psychotic symptoms. Sleep is generally 7\u20138 hours but she stays up late due to procrastination and difficulty disengaging from tasks; no symptoms suggest a primary sleep disorder. She drinks 1\u20132 coffees daily and denies misuse of alcohol or other substances. Medical review is unremarkable. There is a family history of similar lifelong distractibility in her father.\n\nOverall, the presentation reflects a persistent pattern of inattention and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors beginning in childhood, present across settings, and causing clinically significant impairment in occupational and interpersonal functioning, without a better explanation from mood, psychotic, or substance-related conditions.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. R is a 34-year-old paramedic referred by her primary care clinician for persistent anxiety, sleep disturbance, and functional decline following a work-related traumatic incident. Eight months ago, she responded to a multi-vehicle highway collision in which she provided prolonged extrication and attempted resuscitation of a severely injured child who died on scene. She reports that during the event she felt \"completely helpless\" and believed she might die when a vehicle caught fire nearby.\n\nSince the incident, she describes recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive memories that \"hit out of nowhere\" several times per week, often triggered by the smell of gasoline or hearing sirens. She also reports distressing nightmares two to three nights per week in which she relives the scene; she wakes \"soaked in sweat\" and has difficulty returning to sleep. She describes episodes at work in which she briefly feels as if she is back at the crash scene, stating, \"For a moment I\u2019m not in the ambulance\u2014I\u2019m there again,\" accompanied by shaking and a sense of panic. When exposed to reminders (sirens, news about car crashes, or passing that stretch of highway), she experiences intense distress and marked physiologic arousal including heart racing, shortness of breath, and nausea.\n\nShe has made significant efforts to avoid reminders. She refuses to drive on the highway where the crash occurred, takes a longer route to work, and avoids watching news or movies involving accidents. She has asked her supervisor to assign her away from pediatric calls and has called out sick when she anticipates certain shifts. She also avoids talking about the event: \"If someone brings it up, I shut down or leave the room.\" She reports emotional numbing and withdrawal from friends, stating she used to be social but now \"just stays home\" and ignores texts.\n\nShe endorses persistent negative changes in mood and thinking since the incident. She describes a fixed belief that she failed and is to blame: \"If I were faster, that kid would be alive.\" She also reports persistent negative expectations about the world, saying \"Nothing is safe; it can happen anytime.\" She notes diminished interest in hobbies (running, cooking), difficulty experiencing positive emotions (\"I can\u2019t feel happy, even when good things happen\"), and feelings of detachment from others. She reports partial inability to recall parts of the resuscitation sequence: \"It\u2019s like there are blank spots.\" She denies a history of depression prior to the event and denies current suicidal ideation.\n\nShe reports prominent hyperarousal symptoms. She has difficulty falling and staying asleep, averaging 4\u20135 hours per night. She is irritable and has had verbal outbursts at coworkers and family that are \"not like me.\" She describes hypervigilance in public places, sitting with her back to the wall and scanning for danger. She endorses exaggerated startle response to sudden noises (\"If a car backfires, I jump out of my skin\"). She reports poor concentration that has led to errors in charting and missed details at work. She also describes increased checking behaviors at home (locks, smoke detectors) and avoids being alone at night.\n\nSymptoms have been present for approximately eight months, occurring most days, and have caused clinically significant distress and impairment. She reports deteriorating job performance and has received a formal warning for attendance issues. Her interpersonal functioning has declined, with reduced contact with friends and conflict with her sister. She denies hallucinations, manic symptoms, or panic attacks unrelated to reminders of the incident. She denies current substance misuse and states she has not increased alcohol intake since the incident. Medical review is unremarkable; there is no history of seizures or traumatic brain injury. Mental status exam shows an anxious, tense woman with constricted affect; thought process is linear; no delusions; she becomes visibly distressed and tearful when describing the crash and requests to stop briefly.

    "clinical_text": "Ms. R is a 24-year-old laboratory data analyst referred for diagnostic clarification due to longstanding social difficulties and increasing workplace strain described by her supervisor as \u201cdistractible and rigid.\u201d She reports feeling chronically \u201cout of sync with people,\u201d stating, \u201cI can do the work, but the talking part is like trying to decode a language I didn\u2019t grow up with.\u201d\n\nHistory and presenting concerns: She describes persistent difficulty with reciprocal conversation. In meetings she tends to give \u201coverly detailed\u201d monologues about procedures or data quality and often fails to notice when others are bored or want to speak. She reports trouble generating small talk and frequently misses implied meaning, sarcasm, or indirect requests: \u201cIf someone hints, I don\u2019t catch it. If you want something, just say it.\u201d She describes needing explicit rules for social situations and rehearsing scripts before phone calls. She reports that coworkers sometimes view her as blunt; she is surprised when people interpret her as angry. She has difficulty understanding office politics and has been told she \u201cdoesn\u2019t read the room.\u201d\n\nShe reports reduced initiation and maintenance of peer relationships, especially outside structured settings. She has one close friend from college and otherwise prefers solitary activities, noting, \u201cPeople are exhausting. I like them, but I\u2019m done after an hour.\u201d She is interested in connection but finds it confusing and effortful. She states she rarely knows how to enter group conversations and tends to stand at the edge of gatherings. In dating, she reports difficulty interpreting interest and boundaries unless stated directly.\n\nRestricted/repetitive patterns and routines: She describes long-standing highly focused interests that are unusually intense and narrow. Over the last several years she has maintained extensive spreadsheets tracking transit schedules and laboratory error rates \u201cfor fun,\u201d spending hours optimizing categories and color-coding. She becomes notably distressed if plans change without warning: \u201cIf a meeting moves by 15 minutes and nobody tells me, my whole day feels derailed.\u201d She endorses a strong preference for sameness in daily routines (same breakfast, same route to work) and becomes anxious and irritable when forced to deviate.\n\nShe reports repetitive behaviors used for self-regulation, including rubbing the seam of her sleeve, tapping a specific rhythm with her fingers, and rocking slightly when overwhelmed. She attempts to conceal these behaviors at work but notes that suppressing them increases tension.\n\nSensory features: She reports marked sensory sensitivities since childhood. Fluorescent lighting, multiple conversations at once, and certain fabric textures can be painful or nauseating. She wears noise-reducing earbuds during data entry and avoids the cafeteria due to \u201cthe clatter and smells.\u201d She reports occasional shutdowns after sustained sensory overload, described as becoming quiet, tearful, and unable to speak easily: \u201cMy brain just stops producing words.\u201d\n\nDevelopmental course: She recalls differences dating back to early childhood. Her mother (interviewed briefly with patient consent) reports that as a child Ms. R preferred solitary play, lined up toys by color, and became upset if the arrangement was disturbed. She had advanced vocabulary and early reading but struggled with imaginative peer play, tending to \u201clecture\u201d other children about facts. Teachers described her as bright and well-behaved but \u201csocially awkward,\u201d with a tendency to correct others and fixate on specific topics. She did not have significant behavioral disruptions. Her mother reports she was sensitive to loud noises and tags in clothing and had pronounced distress with unexpected schedule changes.\n\nFunctional impact: Academically, she performed well, particularly in structured subjects, but group projects were consistently problematic due to conflict about roles and standards; she often took over to ensure tasks were done \u201cthe right way.\u201d Currently, she is technically strong at work but receives feedback regarding communication style, difficulty with flexible task switching when priorities change abruptly, and becoming overwhelmed in open-office environments. She reports significant fatigue from \u201cmasking\u201d and increasing avoidance of social interactions, contributing to loneliness and anxiety.\n\nOverlapping features prompting referral for attention difficulties: She reports episodes of appearing \u201cchecked out\u201d in meetings and occasional missed details when interrupted. However, on detailed questioning, she describes these lapses as occurring primarily in noisy, multi-speaker situations or when instructions are vague. She states, \u201cIf it\u2019s clear and written down, I\u2019m locked in. If it\u2019s a bunch of people talking at once, I lose the thread.\u201d She demonstrates sustained attention for extended periods when working independently on structured tasks and on her interests, often without needing breaks. She denies a history of chronic careless mistakes across settings, losing items frequently, forgetting daily obligations, or longstanding difficulty completing tasks due to drifting attention. She denies impulsive decision-making, excessive talkativeness, interrupting, risk-taking, or restlessness that is present across contexts; she describes restlessness mainly when overwhelmed by sensory input or uncertainty.\n\nCollateral school history: She reports that as a child she was not described as hyperactive; rather, she was quiet and rule-following. Report cards referenced social isolation and rigidity, not disruptive behavior or persistent inattention. She was able to complete homework independently and on time when expectations were explicit.\n\nMental status (current visit): She presents as neatly dressed with somewhat formal speech. Eye contact is intermittent; she looks away while formulating responses and provides highly detailed, literal answers. Affect is mildly anxious but appropriate. Thought process is logical and detail-oriented. No psychotic symptoms are endorsed. She denies current suicidal ideation. Insight is fair; she recognizes differences in social communication but attributes them to \u201cnot being wired for people.\u201d\n\nSummary of diagnostic question: The overall picture is of lifelong differences in social reciprocity and nonverbal communication, difficulty developing and maintaining relationships, and persistent restricted interests, need for sameness, self-regulatory repetitive behaviors, and sensory hypersensitivity beginning in early development and causing clinically significant impairment in occupational and social functioning. While she has situational attention difficulties (notably during unstructured, sensory-heavy group interactions), the pattern does not reflect pervasive, cross-situational inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity beginning in childhood; instead, attentional strain appears closely linked to sensory overload, ambiguity in instructions, and social-communication demands.",

    "clinical_text": "A 34-year-old middle-school teacher presents to outpatient psychiatry at the encouragement of her spouse for progressively worsening mood and functioning over the past ~8 weeks. She reports feeling \"down and flat most of the day\" and describes a marked loss of interest in activities she previously enjoyed, stating, \"I used to look forward to lesson planning and jogging\u2014now I don\u2019t care about any of it.\" She notes frequent tearfulness, social withdrawal, and irritability, saying she is \"snappy with the kids\" and then feels ashamed afterward.\n\nShe endorses significant sleep disturbance: difficulty falling asleep and early-morning awakening around 4 a.m. with inability to return to sleep. She reports low energy and feeling \"weighted down\" throughout the day, with noticeable decline in productivity at work\u2014she has missed two days recently and is behind on grading. Concentration is impaired: \"I read the same email three times and still can\u2019t process it.\" Appetite has decreased with an unintentional ~8 lb weight loss over 2 months. She reports reduced libido and diminished self-care.\n\nShe describes excessive self-criticism and guilt out of proportion to circumstances: \"I feel like I\u2019m failing everyone. My family would be better off if I wasn\u2019t such a burden.\" She denies a specific plan or intent to harm herself but reports recurrent passive thoughts of death, especially when lying awake at night: \"Sometimes I think it would be easier to not wake up.\" She agrees to reach out to her spouse or crisis services if these thoughts intensify and is willing to collaborate on a safety plan.\n\nNon-standard features include prominent somatic anxiety and intermittent panic-like episodes. Over the same period, she has had near-daily tension headaches and \"a tight chest\" that led her to urgent care once; cardiac evaluation and basic labs were reportedly reassuring. She describes 2\u20133 episodes in the past month of sudden intense fear with palpitations, trembling, shortness of breath, and a sense of \"I\u2019m going to pass out,\" lasting about 10 minutes, occurring unexpectedly while driving or in the grocery store. She worries about having another episode and has begun avoiding the busiest stores. She also notes increased rumination about finances and parenting but recognizes these worries feel \"bigger than the situation.\"\n\nShe denies any history of episodes characterized by persistently elevated or expansive mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, pressured speech, grandiosity, or risky behavior. She denies hallucinations or fixed false beliefs. There is no recent childbirth; last pregnancy was 6 years ago. She denies recent bereavement as a trigger. Medical history is notable only for migraine headaches since adolescence; she takes ibuprofen as needed. No current endocrine symptoms are reported (no heat/cold intolerance, hair loss, or menstrual irregularity). She denies recent stimulant, steroid, or recreational drug use.\n\nSubstance use: She reports increasing alcohol intake from occasional weekend use to 1\u20132 glasses of wine most nights \"to shut my brain off,\" denies morning drinking, blackouts, or withdrawal symptoms, and is open to reducing use.\n\nPsychosocial context: Symptoms began after a change in school administration and increased workload; she also has been caring for an ill parent on weekends. She reports supportive spouse but feels disconnected: \"I\u2019m there physically, but not emotionally.\" Family psychiatric history includes a mother with recurrent depressive episodes treated with medication.\n\nMental status exam: She appears fatigued with mildly slowed movements, maintains limited eye contact, and speaks softly with reduced spontaneity. Mood is \"exhausted and hopeless\" with constricted affect. Thought process is linear but ruminative; thought content notable for worthlessness and passive death wishes without plan/intent. Cognition grossly intact though attention is impaired. Insight and judgment are fair.\n\nOverall presentation is consistent with a sustained depressive syndrome causing clinically significant distress and impairment at work and home, with concurrent anxiety/panic symptoms and increased alcohol use as maladaptive coping. She is interested in treatment options including psychotherapy and medication, and agrees to monitoring of safety and substance use.",

    "clinical_text": "A 34-year-old elementary school teacher presents to outpatient psychiatry reporting persistent, excessive worry occurring most days for the past 9\u201310 months. She describes worry across multiple areas, including job performance (lesson planning, classroom management, emails from administrators), finances (unexpected expenses, mortgage payments), her child\u2019s health and safety, and her own health (fear she may have an undetected illness despite normal checkups). She states, \u201cMy mind is always running worst-case scenarios. Even when something gets resolved, I immediately find something else to worry about.\u201d She reports the worry feels difficult to control: \u201cPeople tell me to relax, but I can\u2019t shut it off. I try to distract myself and it comes right back.\u201d\n\nShe endorses associated symptoms present on most days: feeling keyed up/on edge (\u201clike I\u2019m bracing for something bad to happen\u201d), easy fatigability (\u201cI\u2019m exhausted by mid-afternoon even if the day isn\u2019t physically demanding\u201d), difficulty concentrating (\u201cI reread the same email three times and still worry I missed something\u201d), irritability (\u201cI snap at my husband and then feel guilty\u201d), muscle tension (tight neck and shoulders with frequent jaw clenching), and sleep disturbance (trouble falling asleep due to ruminative thoughts and frequent awakenings). She denies discrete panic attacks; her anxiety is described as chronic and diffuse rather than episodic.\n\nThe symptoms have caused clinically significant distress and impairment. She reports spending hours double-checking lesson plans, repeatedly reviewing bank statements, and seeking reassurance from her spouse, which has led to conflict at home. At work she stays late to \u201cmake sure everything is perfect,\u201d has reduced socializing with colleagues, and feels her productivity has declined due to constant mental preoccupation. She reports occasional headaches and stomach \u201cknots\u201d when worries intensify but no episodes of fainting, chest pain requiring emergency evaluation, or other acute medical complaints.\n\nShe denies persistent depressed mood most days, loss of interest, elevated/expansive mood, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, or other symptoms suggestive of manic/hypomanic episodes. She denies intrusive unwanted thoughts with repetitive rituals, re-experiencing trauma, avoidance related to a traumatic event, or prominent fear limited to specific social scrutiny or a single phobic stimulus. She denies current or past hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized behavior. She denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.\n\nMedical history is unremarkable aside from intermittent tension headaches; she reports normal recent primary care evaluation including thyroid testing. She drinks 1\u20132 cups of coffee daily, denies nicotine use, and drinks alcohol socially (1\u20132 drinks on weekends) without binge episodes. She denies cannabis or other substance use. Current medications include an oral contraceptive only. There is a family history of \u201cchronic worrier\u201d traits in her mother. Mental status examination is notable for an anxious mood with congruent affect, normal speech, linear thought process, and intact insight; attention is mildly impaired by preoccupation with worries. Overall presentation is characterized by excessive, difficult-to-control worry across multiple domains for more than six months with associated somatic and cognitive symptoms causing functional impairment, not attributable to substances, a medical condition, or another primary mental disorder.",

    "clinical_text": "A 28-year-old woman presents for evaluation of longstanding problems with attention, organization, and restlessness that have been present since childhood and are causing impairment at work and at home. She reports that for the past several years\u2014and consistently over the last 6\u201312 months\u2014she has struggled to sustain attention during meetings and while completing reports. She states, \u201cI start reading an email or document and my mind slides off it. I\u2019ll re-read the same paragraph five times.\u201d She describes making avoidable errors in routine tasks (e.g., missing small details in spreadsheets, overlooking items on checklists), leading to feedback from her supervisor about \u201ccareless mistakes\u201d and delayed deliverables.\n\nShe endorses significant difficulty organizing tasks and managing time: \u201cI\u2019m always scrambling\u2014deadlines sneak up even when I put them in my calendar.\u201d She reports frequently starting multiple tasks without finishing them, particularly when work becomes tedious or requires sustained mental effort (e.g., budgets, compliance documentation). She often procrastinates, avoids lengthy administrative work, and feels overwhelmed by multistep assignments. She misplaces essential items several times per week, including her badge, keys, and phone, and keeps \u201cbackup\u201d chargers and key copies due to repeated losses.\n\nShe describes being easily distracted by external stimuli and her own thoughts: \u201cIf someone walks past my desk or my phone buzzes, I\u2019m gone.\u201d At home, she starts chores but leaves them incomplete, moving from laundry to dishes to reorganizing a drawer. She reports frequently forgetting everyday obligations such as returning messages, paying bills on time, and following through on planned errands despite setting reminders.\n\nIn addition to inattentive symptoms, she reports persistent restlessness and difficulty remaining seated. She states, \u201cI\u2019m constantly bouncing my leg. I feel like I\u2019m revving inside.\u201d In meetings she fidgets, taps her pen, and shifts position repeatedly. She often leaves her seat during long sessions, offering to refill water or \u201cjust to take a lap.\u201d She describes feeling \u201con the go\u201d and finds it uncomfortable to have quiet downtime. Her partner notes she often interrupts during conversations and \u201canswers before the question is finished.\u201d The patient acknowledges blurting out comments in meetings and cutting people off, later feeling embarrassed. She also reports impatience when waiting in lines or in slow-moving traffic.\n\nDevelopmental history reveals symptoms were present before age 12. She recalls elementary school report cards frequently stating she was \u201cbright but not working to potential,\u201d \u201ctalks too much,\u201d and \u201cneeds to focus and complete assignments.\u201d She required extra time and repeated prompting to finish homework, often losing worksheets and forgetting to turn in completed assignments. Her parents used structured routines and constant reminders to get her ready for school. Symptoms continued through adolescence and college; she relied on last-minute cramming, all-nighters, and friends\u2019 notes to compensate.\n\nCurrent impairment is clinically significant. Occupationally, she has received a formal performance improvement plan related to missed details, inconsistent follow-through, and time management. Socially, her partner reports frustration with interrupted conversations and uneven division of household responsibilities due to unfinished chores and forgotten errands. The patient reports low self-confidence related to these patterns: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m always behind, like everyone else can just do life.\u201d\n\nShe denies persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, episodic elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, panic attacks, intrusive obsessions/compulsions, psychotic symptoms, or trauma-related re-experiencing. Sleep is generally 7\u20138 hours/night, though she stays up late when procrastinating. Appetite and energy are stable. She denies current or past misuse of stimulants or other substances. Medical history is unremarkable; she is not taking sedating medications.\n\nMental status examination: well-groomed, cooperative. Speech normal rate/volume but occasionally interrupts. Mood \u201cfrustrated\u201d; affect full range. Thought process linear. No delusions or hallucinations. Cognition grossly intact; however, she is noticeably distractible during the interview, glancing at hallway noise and asking for questions to be repeated. Insight and judgment are fair. No suicidal or homicidal ideation.\n\nOverall presentation is characterized by persistent inattention and restlessness/impulsivity across multiple settings since childhood, with clear functional impairment and no better explanation by mood, anxiety, psychotic, or substance-related conditions.",

She reports that during a nighttime call, she and her partner responded to a multi-vehicle collision. While attempting to extricate an injured driver, the vehicle ignited; she witnessed the driver die despite resuscitation efforts. She states, \u201cI can still smell the gasoline and hear him screaming. I thought, \u2018I\u2019m going to die here too.\u2019\u201d She reports intense fear and helplessness during the event.\n\nSince the incident, she endorses recurrent, involuntary, distressing memories of the scene occurring \u201cevery day,\u201d often triggered by sirens, the smell of fuel, or driving past the intersection. She describes nightmares 3\u20134 nights per week in which she relives the crash and wakes \u201csoaked in sweat\u201d with her heart racing. On two occasions she had brief episodes at work where she felt as though she was \u201cback at the crash,\u201d becoming disoriented for several seconds and grabbing her radio \u201clike I was calling for help again.\u201d She reports marked psychological distress and pronounced physical reactions (palpitations, shaking, nausea) when exposed to reminders such as news coverage of car accidents.\n\nShe reports persistent avoidance of trauma-related stimuli. She refuses to drive at night, will not take routes that pass the crash site, and has asked to be reassigned away from motor-vehicle collision calls. She avoids talking about the incident with colleagues and becomes tearful when her partner asks about it: \u201cIf I start thinking about it, I can\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\nShe describes prominent negative changes in mood and cognition since the event. She endorses persistent blame of herself (\u201cIf I\u2019d been faster, he\u2019d be alive\u201d), and recurrent negative beliefs about the world (\u201cNow I know nowhere is safe; anything can happen anytime\u201d). She reports diminished interest in previously enjoyed activities such as running and socializing, stating she \u201cjust stays home\u201d and feels detached from friends and her partner. She describes a restricted range of positive emotions: \u201cEven when something good happens, I feel numb.\u201d She denies persistent guilt about unrelated matters and denies symptoms consistent with a manic or hypomanic episode. She reports mild difficulty recalling parts of the incident immediately after it happened but can otherwise recount the event clearly.\n\nShe endorses increased arousal and reactivity. She has difficulty falling asleep (often taking 2\u20133 hours) and wakes frequently. She is irritable and has had verbal outbursts at work \u201cover small things.\u201d She reports hypervigilance, sitting with her back to the wall in restaurants and repeatedly checking locks at home. She reports an exaggerated startle response to sudden noises (\u201cIf a car backfires, I jump out of my skin\u201d). She also notes difficulty concentrating, making charting errors and rereading the same lines.\n\nSymptoms have been present for 7 months, occur most days, and have led to occupational impairment (reduced shifts, reassigned duties, supervisor concerns about performance) and interpersonal strain (partner reports she is emotionally distant). She denies current suicidal ideation, intent, or plan, and denies a history of suicide attempts. She denies hallucinations or delusional beliefs. She is not taking corticosteroids or other medications known to cause mood or sleep disturbance. She denies increased alcohol use and denies using substances to cope.\n\nMental status exam: She is alert and oriented, with constricted affect and anxious mood. Speech is normal rate and volume. Thought process is linear. Thought content notable for trauma-related guilt and safety concerns without psychotic features. Insight and judgment are fair. During discussion of the incident she becomes visibly tense, tearful, and tachypneic, requesting a brief pause.\n\nOverall presentation is consistent with persistent trauma-related intrusive symptoms, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition/mood, and hyperarousal lasting longer than one month with clinically significant distress and impairment, following exposure to a life-threatening traumatic event in the course of her work.",

    "clinical_text": "He was referred by his primary care clinician for evaluation of \u201canxiety that\u2019s affecting work,\u201d after requesting repeated schedule confirmations and avoiding in-person meetings. He reports feeling \u201con edge\u201d primarily when plans are unclear or when he anticipates last-minute changes, stating, \u201cIf someone moves a meeting without telling me, my brain won\u2019t let it go until I know exactly what\u2019s happening.\u201d He describes a buildup of tension in the hours before team meetings, especially those involving open-ended discussion. He does not endorse persistent worry across multiple life domains; instead, his distress is tightly linked to uncertainty, social performance demands, and sensory overload in the workplace. When provided with a detailed agenda, written instructions, and predictable scheduling, he reports that the anxiety \u201cdrops to almost nothing.\u201d He denies panic attacks, denies persistent insomnia, and reports stable appetite and energy.\n\nIn the interview, his speech is fluent but notably formal and precise, with a tendency toward lengthy, detailed explanations. He frequently interprets questions literally and requests clarification (e.g., when asked about friendships: \u201cDefine friend\u2014someone I speak with weekly or someone I would help move furniture?\u201d). He reports longstanding difficulty with back-and-forth conversation, describing that he can \u201ctalk about systems for hours\u201d but struggles with casual social exchange: \u201cSmall talk feels like lying. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to say.\u201d He describes often missing implied meaning and sarcasm, adding, \u201cPeople think I\u2019m being rude, but I honestly don\u2019t know what they wanted.\u201d He reports that others have commented he appears \u201cdisinterested\u201d because he avoids eye contact: \u201cIf I look at someone\u2019s eyes, I can\u2019t process the words.\u201d His facial expressiveness is limited and his vocal tone is somewhat monotone, though he becomes more animated when discussing his interests.\n\nHe reports few reciprocal friendships and prefers solitary activities. He describes wanting connection but feeling unsure how to maintain relationships: \u201cI can meet someone once and think it went fine, then later I realize they were offended and I didn\u2019t notice.\u201d He tends to communicate best in writing and has relied on scripted phrases for workplace interactions. He reports a history of social misunderstandings at school and work, including being perceived as \u201ctoo blunt\u201d when offering feedback. He denies a history of manic or psychotic symptoms. Mood is generally stable; he denies persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, or suicidal ideation.\n\nHe describes repetitive behaviors and self-regulation strategies that intensify under stress. During the interview he intermittently rubs his fingertips together and taps his foot in a rhythmic pattern; he reports doing this unconsciously to \u201ckeep my body organized.\u201d He endorses pacing and rocking when overwhelmed and occasionally hand-flutters when excited at home. He reports significant distress with unexpected changes in routine: \u201cIf my usual train is canceled, I feel like my whole day is ruined.\u201d He follows rigid routines around meals, commuting, and daily scheduling, including eating the same lunch most days and taking the same route to work. He reports becoming irritable and shutdown when routines are disrupted, describing episodes at work where he went silent and unable to continue after abrupt schedule changes.\n\nHe has highly focused interests that are unusually intense and sustained. He reports a long-standing fascination with rail transit maps and timetables, as well as mechanical keyboard design; he spends hours cataloging specifications and can recall detailed information from memory. He acknowledges that these interests are soothing and \u201cthe one thing that always makes sense.\u201d He has difficulty shifting away from these topics in conversation and has been told he \u201ctalks at people\u201d when excited.\n\nHe endorses sensory sensitivities that contribute to distress in public settings. He reports fluorescent lighting causes headaches and that open-plan office noise is \u201cphysically painful,\u201d leading him to wear noise-canceling headphones and avoid the office cafeteria due to \u201cclanging trays and smells mixing together.\u201d He is selective with clothing textures and avoids certain fabrics because they feel \u201clike sandpaper.\u201d These sensory experiences contribute to his avoidance of crowded environments and can precipitate overwhelm, but he describes this as different from generalized worry: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m imagining disasters; it\u2019s that the sensations and unpredictability are too much.\u201d\n\nDevelopmental history obtained from the patient and corroborated by his mother (by phone, with permission) indicates early and persistent differences. As a child he preferred solitary play, lined up toy cars by size and color, and became distressed if arrangements were changed. His mother recalls he spoke early with an \u201cadult-like vocabulary,\u201d but struggled with peer play and was described by teachers as \u201cbright but socially odd.\u201d He had frequent meltdowns during transitions (e.g., leaving the house, changes in plans) and was noted to be sensitive to loud noises and clothing tags. He excelled academically in structured settings but had difficulty with group projects and unstructured social activities.\n\nFunctionally, he is technically strong at work but has recurring interpersonal and adaptability difficulties. He has requested accommodations such as written instructions, predictable scheduling, and reduced exposure to the open-plan office due to sensory overload. He does not report a pervasive pattern of excessive worry occurring more days than not for at least six months across a broad range of domains, and he does not endorse persistent muscle tension, chronic sleep disturbance, or ongoing difficulty controlling worry outside of situations involving uncertainty, social decoding demands, or sensory stressors. Overall, his current distress appears driven by lifelong social-communication differences, rigidity around routines, intense circumscribed interests, and sensory sensitivities, with situational anxiety emerging secondarily when environmental demands exceed his coping strategies.",

    "clinical_text": "Chief complaint: \u201cI feel empty and tired all the time, like nothing matters.\u201d\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient is a 34-year-old elementary school teacher who presents for evaluation of a persistent low mood and loss of interest lasting approximately 6\u20137 weeks, with notable worsening over the past month. She reports feeling \u201cdown nearly all day, every day,\u201d and states that activities she previously enjoyed (running, reading novels, meeting friends for dinner) \u201cdon\u2019t feel like anything anymore.\u201d She describes prominent fatigue (\u201cI\u2019m exhausted even after doing nothing\u201d), reduced motivation, and difficulty initiating routine tasks such as showering and preparing meals.\n\nShe endorses insomnia characterized by early-morning awakening (waking around 3\u20134 a.m. and unable to return to sleep) most nights, leading to daytime sluggishness. She reports decreased appetite with unintended weight loss of about 8 pounds over the past month. She describes psychomotor slowing noted by herself and her spouse: \u201cI move like I\u2019m in slow motion,\u201d and her spouse has commented that she speaks more quietly and takes longer to respond. She reports impaired concentration and indecisiveness at work (\u201cI reread the same email three times and still can\u2019t focus\u201d), resulting in missed deadlines and a recent negative performance check-in. She describes excessive, pervasive feelings of worthlessness and guilt (\u201cI\u2019m a burden,\u201d \u201cMy students deserve better than me,\u201d \u201cI keep messing everything up\u201d), disproportionate to any objective errors.\n\nSuicidality: She endorses recurrent passive thoughts of death and occasional thoughts such as \u201cIt would be easier not to wake up.\u201d She denies a specific plan or intent, denies preparatory behaviors, and denies prior suicide attempts. She identifies protective factors including her spouse and sense of responsibility to her students, and agrees to seek help if thoughts intensify.\n\nFunctional impact: Symptoms have caused clinically significant distress and impairment\u2014she has used multiple sick days, stopped exercising, withdrawn socially, and reports strained communication with her spouse due to irritability and low energy.\n\nPast psychiatric history: She denies any history of manic or hypomanic episodes, including no periods of abnormally elevated or expansive mood, decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, pressured speech, grandiosity, or risky behavior. No history of psychosis. She reports a brief period of mild depressive symptoms in college that resolved without treatment.\n\nMedical/substance history: She denies recent substance use changes. She drinks 1\u20132 alcoholic beverages on weekends and denies tobacco or illicit drugs. She takes no regular medications. She denies recent head injury. Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable. No known thyroid disease; she has an upcoming primary care appointment for routine labs.\n\nPsychosocial context: She reports increased work stress this school year but no single triggering event. No recent bereavement. She denies intimate partner violence. Family history is notable for depression in her mother treated with medication.\n\nMental status exam (summary): Appearance mildly disheveled; posture slumped. Behavior cooperative, slowed movements. Speech soft, slowed, normal articulation. Mood \u201csad and numb.\u201d Affect constricted, tearful at times, mood-congruent. Thought process linear but slowed. Thought content notable for negative self-evaluation and passive death wishes; no delusions. No hallucinations. Cognition grossly intact; attention diminished. Insight and judgment fair.\n\nOverall, the presentation reflects a sustained episode of depressed mood and markedly diminished interest, accompanied by neurovegetative changes, cognitive symptoms, guilt/worthlessness, and passive suicidal ideation, persisting for more than two weeks and causing significant impairment, without evidence of manic/hypomanic episodes or substance-induced etiology.",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \u201cMy mind won\u2019t shut off. I\u2019m worried all the time and it\u2019s making me scatterbrained.\u201d\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient reports approximately 9\u201310 months of pervasive, difficult-to-control worry occurring on most days. She describes worry spanning multiple domains, including work performance (\u201cI\u2019m always convinced I missed something and the project will fail\u201d), finances (\u201cEven though we\u2019re okay, I keep running numbers in my head\u201d), health of family members (\u201cIf my husband is late, I assume something happened\u201d), and routine responsibilities (\u201cI keep thinking I\u2019ll forget an appointment or mess up something simple\u201d). She notes that attempts to reassure herself provide only brief relief and she quickly shifts to a new concern. She describes this as \u201cconstant background noise\u201d that escalates at night.\n\nAssociated symptoms: She endorses restlessness (\u201cI feel keyed up, like I can\u2019t relax\u201d), muscle tension in her neck/shoulders with frequent jaw clenching, irritability (\u201clittle things set me off at home, then I feel guilty\u201d), fatigue despite adequate opportunity for sleep, and sleep disturbance with prolonged sleep onset due to rumination. She also reports difficulty concentrating and feeling \u201cscattered,\u201d stating she re-reads emails multiple times and loses her train of thought in meetings. She sometimes starts tasks and then switches to another because she is worried she is neglecting something else, describing this as \u201cspinning between tabs because I\u2019m afraid of missing a detail.\u201d She denies discrete episodes of sudden terror with palpitations, choking sensation, or fear of dying; rather, she describes sustained tension and anticipatory worry.\n\nFunctional impact: At work, she spends excessive time checking and re-checking her work and seeks reassurance from colleagues, which has slowed her productivity and led to missed internal deadlines. At home, she has difficulty being present during conversations and often asks for repetition. She reports decreased enjoyment of leisure activities because she feels she \u201cshould be doing something productive\u201d or is mentally preoccupied. She reports increased conflict with her spouse due to irritability and persistent need for reassurance.\n\nCourse and triggers: She identifies no single precipitating trauma. Symptoms intensified after a reorganization at work increased ambiguity in her role, but the worry has generalized beyond work. She reports that on vacations she initially feels slightly better, but within a day or two her mind finds new topics to worry about (e.g., travel logistics, safety, finances).\n\nAttention/impulsivity developmental history (to evaluate overlapping features): She is concerned she may have an attention disorder because of distractibility and task-switching. However, she reports doing well academically throughout childhood and college, with no history of significant inattention, hyperactivity, behavioral problems, or teacher/parent concerns. She recalls being \u201ca bit perfectionistic and nervous before exams,\u201d but she was able to complete homework independently, kept her room organized, and did not have chronic lateness or frequent lost items in childhood. She denies longstanding patterns of impulsivity, risk-taking, or chronic disorganization prior to the past year. She states her current inattention is most pronounced when she is worrying and improves temporarily when she feels reassured or when tasks are clearly structured with immediate feedback.\n\nPsychiatric review of systems: She denies persistently depressed mood most of the day nearly every day; she reports occasional low mood secondary to stress but no anhedonia. Denies suicidal ideation, intent, or plan. Denies periods of abnormally elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, grandiosity, or pressured speech. Denies obsessions with compulsive rituals aimed at neutralizing intrusive thoughts; her checking is described as worry-driven reassurance rather than rigid, time-consuming rituals. Denies intrusive traumatic memories, nightmares, or avoidance related to a traumatic event. Denies prominent fear of social scrutiny as the primary problem; she is comfortable presenting but worries about performance broadly across contexts.\n\nMedical/substance history: No known thyroid disease, arrhythmia, seizure disorder, or chronic pain condition. Reports occasional tension headaches. No stimulant use. Caffeine intake is stable; she notes that additional coffee worsens jitteriness. No recent medication changes.\n\nFamily and psychosocial history: Mother described as \u201ca worrier.\u201d No known family history of bipolar disorder. Supportive spouse; stable housing. Reports high personal standards and a tendency to catastrophize.\n\nMental status (observational): Well-groomed, cooperative, mildly fidgety. Speech normal rate and volume. Mood \u201cstressed,\u201d affect anxious but reactive. Thought process linear yet ruminative with frequent \u201cwhat if\u201d content. No delusions or hallucinations. Cognition grossly intact; attention appears intermittently impaired during the interview when she shifts to anticipated future problems. Insight and judgment fair.\n\nClinical impression (summary without labels): Presentation is characterized by excessive, pervasive worry occurring most days for >6 months across multiple domains, difficulty controlling the worry, and associated symptoms including restlessness, fatigue, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance, and concentration difficulties causing functional impairment. Overlapping features with attentional complaints are present, but the developmental history does not support a lifelong pattern of symptoms; attentional difficulties appear temporally linked to persistent worry and heightened arousal rather than a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental condition. Symptoms are not better accounted for by episodic mood elevation, trauma-related symptoms, discrete panic episodes, substance effects, or a primary compulsive syndrome.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. R is a 29-year-old paramedic referred by her primary care clinician for persistent difficulties with attention, organization, and follow-through that have begun to threaten her work performance. She reports, \u201cMy brain feels like it has 12 tabs open,\u201d and describes frequently starting tasks and then shifting to another without finishing the first. She misplaces essential items (keys, phone, badge, medication box) \u201calmost daily,\u201d relies heavily on alarms and sticky notes, and still misses appointments and deadlines. She says she often reads the same paragraph repeatedly because her mind drifts, and in conversations she \u201czones out\u201d despite trying to focus. She forgets details of handoff reports unless she writes them down immediately.\n\nAt work, she reports a pattern of making preventable errors under routine conditions\u2014e.g., forgetting to restock supplies, leaving documentation incomplete, or skipping steps when interrupted. Supervisors note she is capable and quick-thinking in emergencies but inconsistent with routine paperwork and station tasks. She describes being easily sidetracked by noises and coworkers\u2019 conversations, and she avoids tasks that require sustained mental effort such as long charts or training modules, stating, \u201cI\u2019ll do anything else first, even clean the kitchen, then it\u2019s 2 a.m. and I\u2019m panicking.\u201d She also describes chronic procrastination followed by intense last-minute \u201ccram mode.\u201d\n\nShe endorses longstanding restlessness: \u201cI\u2019m always tapping, bouncing my leg, pacing while on the phone.\u201d During the interview she frequently shifts posture, fidgets with her lanyard, and interrupts at times, later apologizing. She describes blurting out comments and finishing others\u2019 sentences, particularly when she feels impatient. She notes difficulty waiting in lines and becomes irritable during slow processes, though she denies physical aggression. She reports that these patterns have been present for as long as she can remember: as a child she was described as \u201cbright but scattered,\u201d frequently forgot homework, lost school materials, talked excessively in class, and received repeated comments on report cards about not working to potential and needing to \u201cpay attention.\u201d She recalls needing parents to check her backpack nightly. She denies a period of normal functioning followed by sudden onset of these issues.\n\nShe reports that symptoms occur across settings: at home she starts chores and leaves them unfinished (laundry half-folded, dishes partially done), forgets bills unless autopay is set, and struggles to plan multi-step activities. Her partner reports she \u201cdoesn\u2019t listen,\u201d though Ms. R states she cares but her attention \u201cslips.\u201d She reports frequent near-misses while driving such as missing exits or realizing she has been \u201con autopilot,\u201d but denies major accidents caused by intoxication. She denies episodes of elevated mood, decreased need for sleep with increased goal-directed activity, or grandiosity.\n\nDiagnostic complexity arises because she also reports a history of occupational exposure to distressing scenes and one particularly severe call 10 months ago involving a pediatric fatality. She describes feeling \u201cshaken for a few weeks\u201d afterward, with difficulty falling asleep on some nights and increased startle to loud noises while on shift. However, she denies recurrent involuntary intrusive memories that \u201cbarge in\u201d outside of reminders; denies flashbacks; denies recurrent trauma-related nightmares (she reports occasional non-specific stress dreams without the event content); and denies persistent avoidance of reminders\u2014she continues to work as a paramedic, can discuss the event, and does not avoid the neighborhood or related dispatches. She does not describe persistent negative beliefs about herself or the world, emotional numbing, or persistent guilt/shame specifically tied to the event. She reports that her concentration problems were present years before the call and have been consistent across her schooling and multiple jobs. She attributes recent worsening to increased workload, rotating shifts, and reduced structure.\n\nShe reports sleep disruption primarily related to shift work and \u201clying awake because my mind won\u2019t shut off,\u201d with racing thoughts about unfinished tasks rather than reliving the event. She denies panic attacks tied to trauma reminders. She endorses some generalized worry about performance and letting others down, but worries are described as secondary to repeated disorganization and mistakes. She denies psychotic symptoms. Appetite is variable with schedule; weight stable. Mood is \u201cfrustrated and embarrassed,\u201d with occasional tearfulness about underperforming; she denies persistent anhedonia, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation.\n\nMedical history includes mild asthma. No history of head injury with loss of consciousness. Current medications: albuterol as needed; no psychiatric medications. Family history notable for a sibling described as \u201calways hyper\u201d and treated in childhood for attention/behavior issues. Mental status exam: well-groomed, cooperative, mildly restless; speech normal rate/volume but occasionally tangential with easy distractibility; mood \u201cstressed,\u201d affect congruent; thought process generally coherent; no delusions or hallucinations; cognition grossly intact; attention fluctuates during interview; insight and judgment fair. She expresses a clear goal of improving reliability and reducing errors and is open to structured supports.\n\nOverall, she presents with a chronic, cross-situational pattern of inattention and impulsive/restless behaviors with onset in childhood, causing clinically significant impairment in occupational and home functioning. Trauma exposure is acknowledged, but trauma-specific symptom clusters are not persistently present, and the attentional difficulties clearly predate the identified event.",

    "clinical_text": "A 34-year-old paramedic presents to outpatient psychiatry at the urging of her supervisor after increasing sick days and a recent on-scene \u201cfreeze\u201d episode. Nine months ago, she responded to a multi-vehicle collision involving a school van. She reports being trapped in the wreckage area with ongoing risk of fire and hearing people screaming while she attempted to triage. She performed prolonged resuscitation efforts on a child who died at the scene. She describes feeling \u201chelpless, like my hands wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d and recalls intense fear that the vehicles would ignite while she was inside the debris field.\n\nSince that event, she endorses recurrent, involuntary, intrusive memories that \u201cbarge in\u201d several times per day, often triggered by the smell of gasoline, the sound of sirens, or seeing a van similar to the one involved. She reports distressing nightmares 3\u20134 nights per week with themes of being trapped and unable to help; she awakens \u201csoaked in sweat\u201d and takes an hour or more to fall back asleep. On two occasions at work, she experienced brief episodes where she felt as if she were back at the crash scene; she describes staring at the roadway and hearing \u201cthe screaming again\u201d for a few seconds, followed by shaking and a rapid heartbeat. During triggers, she sometimes feels detached from her body, stating, \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m watching myself from outside,\u201d lasting minutes and resolving when she grounds herself by touching a cold surface.\n\nShe describes strong efforts to avoid reminders: she has rerouted her commute to avoid highways, refuses to watch news footage of accidents, and asks colleagues to take pediatric trauma calls when possible. She avoids discussing the incident with family and becomes visibly tense when her partner asks about her day. She states, \u201cIf I talk about it, it\u2019s like I\u2019m inviting it back.\u201d\n\nShe reports persistent negative changes in thoughts and mood since the incident. She endorses guilt and self-blame (\u201cI should have done something different\u2026 I keep replaying what I missed\u201d), a more negative view of the world (\u201cNothing is safe; anything can happen anytime\u201d), and diminished interest in previously enjoyed activities such as running and socializing. She feels emotionally numb at times and describes feeling detached from her partner and friends: \u201cThey\u2019re talking and I\u2019m there, but I\u2019m not really there.\u201d She denies persistent inability to remember key aspects of the event, though notes the timeline feels \u201cscrambled\u201d when she tries to recount it.\n\nShe also reports marked changes in arousal and reactivity: irritability with \u201csnapping\u201d at coworkers, difficulty concentrating during routine charting, hypervigilance in public places (sits facing exits, scans for hazards), and an exaggerated startle response to sudden noises. Sleep is fragmented with difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep. She denies physically aggressive behavior but reports clenching her jaw and pacing at night. She reports intermittent panic-like surges when exposed to reminders (palpitations, chest tightness, trembling), lasting 5\u201315 minutes, and worries about having them at work.\n\nThese symptoms have persisted for over six months and have worsened in the past two months, contributing to occupational impairment (missed shifts, reduced confidence on calls, declined leadership responsibilities) and relationship strain (increased arguments, reduced intimacy). To cope with sleep and anxiety, she has increased alcohol intake from 1\u20132 drinks per week to 2\u20133 drinks on most nights, acknowledging, \u201cI know it\u2019s not helping long-term, but it\u2019s the only thing that shuts my brain off.\u201d She denies morning drinking, withdrawal symptoms, or prior legal issues. She denies current or past manic symptoms, psychotic symptoms, or obsessive-compulsive rituals. She endorses passive thoughts such as \u201cI wish I could just not wake up after a nightmare\u201d during particularly bad weeks but denies intent, plan, preparatory behaviors, or prior attempts; she identifies protective factors including her partner, commitment to her patients, and willingness to seek help.\n\nMental status examination: She is alert and oriented, cooperative but guarded. Affect is constricted and anxious; mood described as \u201con edge and exhausted.\u201d Thought process is linear; thought content notable for guilt and threat-focused beliefs without delusions. No hallucinations. Insight is fair; judgment intact. Psychomotor activity mildly increased when discussing the incident (fidgeting, tearful).\n\nShe reports no significant head injury from the event, no seizures, and no substance use other than alcohol and occasional caffeine. Medical review is otherwise unremarkable aside from migraines. She is seeking treatment to \u201csleep without reliving it\u201d and to function reliably at work again.",

    "clinical_text": "Reason for visit: The patient was referred by the university counseling center for longstanding social and communication difficulties and increasing functional problems in group-based coursework and at work.\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient reports persistent difficulty understanding social expectations and maintaining relationships. He states, \u201cI never know when it\u2019s my turn to talk,\u201d and \u201cPeople say I\u2019m blunt, but I\u2019m just being accurate.\u201d He describes frequent misinterpretation of humor and sarcasm: \u201cIf someone says \u2018Nice job\u2019 and their tone is weird, I can\u2019t tell if they mean it. I just assume they\u2019re mad.\u201d He avoids social gatherings because they feel unpredictable and exhausting. When he attends, he tends to stand on the edge of the room and leaves early due to sensory discomfort and uncertainty about what to do. He has a strong preference for communicating by text/email because \u201cit\u2019s clearer and I can edit before I send.\u201d\n\nSocial communication/interaction: He describes limited reciprocal conversation unless discussing his specific interests. Roommates report that he often talks at length about a single topic without noticing others\u2019 cues. He acknowledges difficulty asking follow-up questions and reading others\u2019 facial expressions: \u201cI can\u2019t tell if someone is bored unless they literally tell me.\u201d He reports discomfort with eye contact: \u201cIt feels like staring; I look at people\u2019s mouths or off to the side.\u201d In session, he makes intermittent eye contact, uses a somewhat monotone prosody, and provides highly detailed, literal answers. He has difficulty interpreting the clinician\u2019s open-ended questions and repeatedly asks for clarification (\u201cDo you mean in the last week or in general?\u201d). He reports few close friendships; relationships tend to fade because he \u201cforgets to check in\u201d and does not notice when others are upset unless explicitly stated. He has never had a romantic relationship and reports uncertainty about flirting and boundaries.\n\nRestricted/repetitive patterns and rigidity: He endorses longstanding routines and distress with unexpected change. \u201cIf my schedule gets moved around, my whole day is ruined,\u201d and he becomes irritable and anxious. He reports eating the same breakfast daily and taking the same walking route to campus; a route closure last month led to a \u201cshutdown\u201d where he sat on a bench for 30 minutes feeling overwhelmed and unable to decide an alternative path. He describes repetitive behaviors since childhood such as hand-fidgeting and rocking when stressed; he currently taps fingers in patterns during the interview.\n\nHighly restricted interests: He reports an intense, circumscribed interest in train systems and transit maps since early childhood. He spends multiple hours nightly cataloging route changes and reading technical manuals \u201cfor fun.\u201d He states, \u201cI can tell you the model and year of most locomotives I see,\u201d and becomes animated and noticeably more fluent when discussing this topic. He struggles to shift to other topics unless prompted.\n\nSensory sensitivities: He describes significant sensory hyperreactivity: fluorescent lights cause headaches; he wears noise-canceling headphones in dining halls; certain clothing textures are \u201cunbearable.\u201d He reports being overwhelmed by overlapping sounds and has left lectures due to \u201ctoo much noise and people moving.\u201d\n\nDevelopmental history: His mother (contacted with consent) reports early signs in childhood: limited social engagement in preschool, preference for solitary play, and difficulty with imaginative peer play. He spoke his first words on time but used unusually formal language early and tended to speak \u201clike a little professor.\u201d Teachers noted he was academically advanced but struggled with group work, interpreted instructions literally, and became distressed when classroom routines changed. He had few friends and was often described as \u201cquiet\u201d or \u201codd.\u201d He had repetitive behaviors (lining up toy trains, repeatedly watching the same clips) and intense interests. No history of developmental regression.\n\nFunctional impact: Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in current functioning. He is at risk of failing a required group capstone because peers report he \u201cdoesn\u2019t collaborate,\u201d becomes upset when plans change, and sends lengthy corrective messages about minor errors. At work, he performs well on technical tasks but has received feedback about tone in customer interactions and difficulty handling unexpected requests.\n\nMood, anxiety, psychosis screening: He denies current major depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, manic episodes, hallucinations, or delusions. He reports situational anxiety primarily related to social uncertainty and sensory overload rather than pervasive worry across domains.\n\nCognitive/learning and medical considerations: He has no history of intellectual disability; academic history suggests average-to-high intellectual functioning. No history suggestive of traumatic brain injury, seizures, or significant medical illness. No substance use. Family history notable for a paternal uncle described as \u201cvery socially awkward\u201d with intense hobbies.\n\nMental status examination (salient): Appearance neat; behavior cooperative but somewhat stiff; psychomotor notable for finger tapping; speech normal rate but somewhat monotone; mood \u201cstressed\u201d; affect constricted; thought process linear and detail-focused; thought content without psychosis; cognition grossly intact; insight fair (recognizes differences but attributes many issues to \u201cother people being unclear\u201d); judgment fair.\n\nOverall clinical impression: The presentation reflects a lifelong pattern of social-communication difficulties across settings alongside restricted/repetitive behaviors, insistence on sameness, circumscribed interests, and sensory sensitivities beginning in early development and causing significant impairment in social, academic, and occupational functioning, without evidence that symptoms are better accounted for by intellectual disability, psychotic disorder, or mood disorder.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. R is a 39-year-old ED nurse presenting to outpatient psychiatry at the urging of her primary care clinician for \"burnout that feels like something darker.\" She reports approximately 7\u20138 weeks of persistent low mood and markedly reduced interest in activities she previously enjoyed (\"I used to love running and cooking\u2014now I just sit and stare at the TV and nothing lands\"). She describes feeling \"numb and heavy\" most days, with frequent tearfulness at work and at home. She has been calling out sick more often and has received feedback that she appears disengaged and is making more documentation errors.\n\nShe endorses significant sleep disruption beyond her usual shift-related pattern. Even on non-night-shift weeks she has difficulty initiating sleep, wakes at 3\u20134 AM, and cannot return to sleep (\"my mind just loops\u2014how I\u2019m failing everyone\"). She reports daytime fatigue and low energy (\"it\u2019s like my limbs are made of sand\"), and she has stopped exercising entirely. Appetite has decreased with an unintentional weight loss of about 8 pounds over the past month; she reports nausea and a \"tight stomach\" when trying to eat, leading her to skip meals during shifts. She reports impaired concentration and slowed thinking (\"I read the same chart note three times and can\u2019t hold it\").\n\nCognitively, she endorses pervasive feelings of worthlessness and excessive guilt. She repeatedly states, \"I\u2019m a terrible mom\" and \"my husband would be better off without me,\" despite acknowledging that her family is supportive. She describes increased irritability, snapping at her children and coworkers, which is uncharacteristic for her and contributes to her guilt. Psychomotor changes are subtle but noted: she describes moving more slowly at home and coworkers have asked if she is \"okay\" because she looks \"slowed down\"; in session, her speech is quieter with mildly slowed rate.\n\nRegarding anxiety, she reports longstanding worry that intensified with the current episode, centered on work performance and family safety. She experiences intermittent episodes of palpitations and shortness of breath lasting 5\u201310 minutes when she anticipates going into work, but she does not describe avoidance of specific situations beyond occasional sick days. She denies obsessive thoughts, compulsive behaviors, trauma-related flashbacks, or nightmares.\n\nShe reports passive thoughts of death occurring several times per week: \"Sometimes I think it wouldn\u2019t matter if I didn\u2019t wake up.\" She denies current intent or plan, denies preparatory behaviors, and states she would not act because of her children. She denies access to firearms; medications are stored in a shared cabinet. She agrees to a safety plan and to involve her spouse if thoughts intensify.\n\nShe denies any history of periods of abnormally elevated or expansive mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, unusually talkative speech, racing thoughts, increased goal-directed activity, or risky behavior. She denies hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia. She denies recent substance misuse; she reports drinking wine 3\u20134 nights per week (1\u20132 glasses) \"to take the edge off\" and denies morning drinking, blackouts, or withdrawal symptoms. No recent medication changes are reported; she states her thyroid levels were checked within the past 2 months and were \"normal,\" and she denies heat/cold intolerance, hair changes, or other new endocrine symptoms.\n\nFunctionally, she reports diminished ability to manage household tasks and parenting responsibilities, increased conflict with her spouse about her withdrawal, and reduced performance at work. She identifies no clear single trigger but notes cumulative stress from rotating shifts and a recent critical incident in the ED that left her feeling \"shaken,\" though she does not report intrusive re-experiencing or hypervigilance outside of generalized worry. She is seeking help because \"I don\u2019t recognize myself, and it\u2019s not lifting.\"",

    "clinical_text": "A 34-year-old project coordinator presents for evaluation due to \"months of feeling on edge\" and persistent worry that she \"can\u2019t shut off.\" She reports that for approximately 8\u20139 months she has been worrying excessively most days about multiple areas: work performance and being fired despite positive reviews, her child\u2019s health and safety (e.g., replaying news stories about accidents and imagining it happening to her family), finances (despite stable income), and her own health (e.g., interpreting benign sensations as signs of serious illness). She states, \"Even when something is going well, my brain finds the next thing that could go wrong.\" She describes the worry as difficult to control and time-consuming, often checking emails late into the night, repeatedly reviewing calendars, and seeking reassurance from her spouse.\n\nShe endorses associated symptoms occurring on most days over the same period: feeling keyed up/restless (\"like my body is revving\"), becoming easily fatigued by mid-afternoon, difficulty concentrating (\"I reread the same paragraph five times\"), irritability (snapping at her spouse and coworkers, which she regrets), prominent muscle tension (neck and jaw clenching with tension headaches), and sleep disturbance with difficulty falling asleep due to ruminative worry and waking unrefreshed. She denies discrete panic attacks, though she sometimes notices a racing heart when overwhelmed and then returns to baseline once she steps away.\n\nFunctionally, she reports reduced efficiency at work due to overchecking and procrastination driven by fear of mistakes, leading to missed informal deadlines and conflict with a colleague. At home she is more avoidant of making plans because she anticipates something will go wrong, and she has stopped exercising regularly because she feels \"too tired and tense,\" though she wants to restart. She says, \"I\u2019m not lazy\u2014I\u2019m just constantly bracing for impact.\" She acknowledges feeling discouraged and occasionally tearful, especially after a day of intense worry, and she describes herself as \"burned out.\" However, she denies a persistent depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, for two weeks or longer. She reports that when she can disengage from worry\u2014such as during a movie night with her family or when visiting friends\u2014she still experiences enjoyment and laughter. She denies loss of interest in all or most activities; instead she states she \"still wants to do things\" but feels too preoccupied and keyed up to relax. Appetite is generally stable; she reports mild stress-related nausea at times but no significant weight change. She denies psychomotor slowing. She denies feelings of worthlessness or pervasive guilt, endorsing instead self-criticism centered on worry about making mistakes. She denies suicidal ideation, intent, or plan and denies past self-harm.\n\nShe reports no history of manic or hypomanic symptoms (no periods of abnormally elevated/expansive mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, or risky behavior). She denies obsessions with compulsive rituals beyond reassurance seeking and checking emails related to work; she describes these behaviors as attempts to manage worry rather than intrusive taboo thoughts or elaborate compulsions. She denies trauma-related flashbacks or nightmares and denies avoidance linked to a traumatic event. There is no evidence of psychosis.\n\nMedical history is notable only for seasonal allergies and episodic tension headaches. She drinks 1\u20132 cups of coffee daily and notes that more caffeine worsens her jitteriness. Alcohol is limited to 1\u20132 drinks on weekends; she denies withdrawal symptoms. She takes no stimulants and denies recreational drug use. She recently had a primary care visit including basic labs and thyroid testing that she reports were normal. Family history includes a mother described as a \"constant worrier\" and a paternal uncle with alcohol use disorder.\n\nMental status exam: well-groomed, cooperative, mildly fidgety; speech normal rate and volume; mood \"stressed\" with anxious affect; thought process linear but ruminative; thought content notable for excessive worry and catastrophic predictions; no delusions; no hallucinations; cognition grossly intact though distractible; insight and judgment fair. She expresses motivation for treatment and asks, \"Is there a way to stop my brain from running worst-case scenarios all day?\"",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. R is a 28-year-old software engineer referred by her primary care clinician for longstanding concentration problems and increasing work stress. She describes a pattern of \u201cconstantly falling behind\u201d despite strong technical skills. She reports that she often starts tasks with good intentions but then \u201cgets pulled into something else\u201d and returns later to find multiple unfinished items. She states, \u201cI can read the same paragraph five times and it doesn\u2019t stick,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll open my laptop to answer an email and somehow I\u2019m reorganizing folders, then I\u2019m scrolling through documentation, then it\u2019s been 45 minutes.\u201d She endorses frequent careless mistakes in routine work (e.g., misreading requirements, missing small details in code reviews), difficulty sustaining attention during meetings, and needing to re-watch recorded meetings because her mind \u201cwanders even when it matters.\u201d\n\nShe reports prominent organizational difficulties: her desk and digital workspace are cluttered, she misses steps in multi-part tasks, and she underestimates the time required for assignments. She frequently procrastinates on tasks that require sustained mental effort (e.g., writing documentation, preparing status updates), describing a \u201cmental wall\u201d and feeling physically restless when trying to do them. She often misplaces her badge, headphones, or phone and keeps buying replacements. She relies heavily on reminders but still forgets to respond to messages, pay bills on time, or attend appointments unless they are placed directly in her calendar with multiple alerts. At home, she starts chores and leaves them half-done (laundry in washer overnight, dishes half-loaded) and reports her roommate has commented that she \u201cseems scattered.\u201d\n\nShe also describes a sense of internal restlessness and impatience that others notice. She says she interrupts in conversations \u201cwithout meaning to,\u201d finishes others\u2019 sentences, and has difficulty waiting her turn in group discussions. She describes herself as \u201calways fidgeting,\u201d tapping her foot during meetings, and feeling uncomfortable sitting still through movies unless she is also on her phone. She denies episodes of elevated mood, grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, or risk-taking behavior beyond occasional impulsive purchases of small items when stressed.\n\nRegarding anxiety, Ms. R states, \u201cI\u2019m worried all the time,\u201d but on detailed questioning her worries are predominantly tied to specific consequences of missed deadlines, overlooked details, and last-minute scrambling. She reports that on weeks when she is on track (e.g., after external structure such as a sprint kickoff or a coworker checking in daily), her worry significantly decreases. She does not endorse a broad, persistent pattern of excessive worry across multiple unrelated domains (e.g., health, family safety, finances, world events) occurring most days over many months. Instead, she describes spikes of worry that arise after she realizes she forgot something or is running late: \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m calm until I notice I dropped the ball, and then I spiral for a couple hours.\u201d She denies chronic muscle tension; she reports occasional headaches that she attributes to late nights and caffeine. Sleep is variable: she often stays up late trying to \u201cmake up time\u201d for earlier distraction, then feels tired and unfocused the next day. She endorses occasional stomach \u201cbutterflies\u201d right before presentations, but denies persistent physical symptoms of anxiety on most days. She does not avoid social situations due to fear of scrutiny; rather, she worries about being unprepared because she put tasks off.\n\nDevelopmental history reveals that these attention and organization difficulties were present in childhood. She recalls needing frequent redirection in elementary school, losing homework, forgetting to bring materials home, and being described on report cards as \u201cbright but not working to potential\u201d and \u201ctalks too much.\u201d She states, \u201cMy backpack was a black hole,\u201d and her parents often had to help her pack for school. In middle school and high school, she did well on tests but struggled with long-term assignments, starting projects the night before and staying up late to finish. In college, she relied on all-nighters, last-minute pressure, and studying in highly stimulating environments to stay engaged. She reports these patterns have continued across settings (school, home, and workplace) and have caused impairment, including performance reviews citing inconsistent follow-through and missed details, as well as chronic interpersonal friction with her roommate over unfinished chores.\n\nShe denies current or past major depressive episodes, panic attacks, trauma-related symptoms, compulsive rituals, psychotic symptoms, or substance misuse. She denies suicidal ideation or history of self-harm. Medical review is unremarkable; she denies thyroid disease and reports normal recent labs through primary care. Family history is notable for a father described as \u201cdisorganized and always late\u201d and a younger brother who struggled academically and required extra support in school.\n\nMental status examination shows a well-groomed woman who is cooperative and engaged. She is mildly fidgety and frequently shifts posture. Speech is normal rate and volume. Mood is \u201cstressed\u201d; affect is full range and reactive. Thought process is generally linear but occasionally tangential when describing work workflows; she returns to topic with redirection. No delusions or hallucinations. Cognition is grossly intact; attention is variable during the interview, with occasional need for repetition of questions. Insight and judgment are fair. She expresses strong motivation to improve functioning and describes relief at having a framework for understanding her longstanding patterns.\n\nOverall, her presentation is characterized by a chronic, developmentally rooted pattern of inattention, disorganization, distractibility, forgetfulness, and impulsive interruption/restlessness across multiple contexts with clear functional impairment. Her reported worry appears largely secondary to repeated lapses in planning and follow-through, fluctuates with external structure, and lacks the pervasive, multi-domain, difficult-to-control quality required for a separate generalized worry syndrome.",

    "clinical_text": "A 34-year-old paramedic presents for evaluation at the urging of her primary care clinician due to persistent sleep disturbance, irritability, and worsening work performance over the past 8 months. She reports that 8 months ago she responded to an overnight call for an \"injured person\" in an alley. On arrival, she and a partner were confronted by two assailants; she was grabbed and held at knifepoint while her partner was struck repeatedly. She recalls believing she would be killed and hearing her partner \"making a choking sound\" while she could not move. Police arrived within minutes; her partner survived but had prolonged medical recovery. The patient required treatment for bruising but no major physical injury.\n\nSince the incident, she reports recurrent, unwanted memories that \"barge in\" during the day, often triggered by the smell of diesel fuel or a specific ringtone similar to the dispatch tone. She describes episodes at work in which she briefly feels as if she is \"back in that alley\" and momentarily loses track of her surroundings; during one call she \"froze\" for several seconds and then felt panicked and ashamed. She endorses nightmares 3\u20134 nights per week with themes of being trapped or unable to speak; she wakes drenched in sweat and checks the door locks repeatedly. She reports marked psychological distress and physical reactions (heart racing, nausea, shaking) when she hears sirens, sees men wearing hooded sweatshirts in poorly lit areas, or approaches the neighborhood where the event occurred.\n\nShe describes avoidance of reminders: she now tries to swap out night shifts, avoids certain routes, refuses calls near the alley, and will not watch news stories involving assaults. She states, \"I don\u2019t even want to talk about it\u2014I feel like if I start, I won\u2019t stop.\" She avoids discussing the incident with her partner and has stopped attending informal gatherings with coworkers because \"they\u2019ll bring it up.\" She also reports more general withdrawal: she used to run and meet friends for brunch, but now stays home most weekends.\n\nIn terms of mood and cognition, she reports persistent guilt and self-blame: \"I should have fought harder. I froze. I failed him.\" She endorses a more negative view of the world, stating, \"People are dangerous. Anything can happen and no one can protect you.\" She reports reduced interest in previously enjoyed activities, feeling detached from friends and family, and difficulty experiencing positive emotions: \"Even when something good happens, it feels muted.\" She notes difficulty concentrating, especially while writing reports, and describes periods of fogginess. She denies persistent depressed mood most of the day nearly every day, but reports frequent tearfulness and feeling \"on edge\" and ashamed.\n\nShe endorses hyperarousal symptoms including insomnia (takes 1\u20132 hours to fall asleep, frequent awakenings), irritability and angry outbursts (snapping at coworkers and a close friend), hypervigilance (sits facing doors in restaurants, scans parking lots), and an exaggerated startle response to sudden noises. She reports engaging in more risk-taking than usual by driving fast after shifts \"to get home quickly\" and admits this has led to one near-miss accident. She denies physical aggression toward others. She denies current or past mania/hypomania.\n\nShe reports occasional episodes of feeling unreal or \"like I\u2019m watching myself from the outside\" when stressed, particularly when she smells diesel or hears dispatch tones; these episodes last minutes and resolve when she grounds herself by touching cold objects. She denies hearing voices or fixed false beliefs. She denies current suicidal intent or plan, but endorses passive thoughts such as \"Sometimes I think it would be easier to just not wake up\" after severe nightmares; she identifies protective factors including her younger sister and responsibility at work and agrees to seek urgent help if thoughts worsen.\n\nFunctionally, she has received a warning for tardiness and reduced productivity. She has called out sick more frequently and reports increased conflict with colleagues. She reports worsening headaches and neck tension; medical workup to date has been non-revealing. She has increased alcohol intake from 1\u20132 drinks on weekends to 2\u20133 drinks most nights \"to shut my brain off,\" with occasional morning grogginess; she denies withdrawal symptoms, daytime drinking, or alcohol-related legal issues, but acknowledges this is a change and is concerned.\n\nPast history includes no prior trauma-related treatment; she reports a history of mild performance anxiety in school but no prior panic attacks, no prior episodes of prolonged depression, and no previous psychiatric medications. Family history is notable for a father with heavy alcohol use. She is not taking prescribed psychotropic medications. On mental status exam, she is cooperative but guarded when discussing the incident, becomes visibly tense, and her speech briefly quickens when describing triggers. Mood is \"tired and wired\"; affect is anxious and constricted. Thought process is linear. No hallucinations or delusions are elicited. Cognition is grossly intact though attention is distractible. Insight is fair. Judgment is intact, though she acknowledges risky driving when distressed.\n\nShe states, \"I want to feel like myself again, but I can\u2019t turn it off,\" and requests help with sleep and \"not freaking out\" during calls.",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \"I don't get people. I say the wrong thing and then everyone is mad.\" \n\nHistory of present illness: The patient is a 22-year-old man referred by his university counseling center for long-standing social difficulties and increasing distress as group-based coursework and job expectations have intensified. He reports chronic trouble initiating and sustaining conversations, especially with peers, stating, \"I can talk about my interests for hours, but I don't know when to stop or how to switch topics.\" He describes conversations as \"like following a script,\" and notes he often misses jokes or implied meanings: \"If someone hints at something, I usually don't catch it unless they say it directly.\" He reports that others have called him \"blunt\" and \"robotic.\" He denies depressed mood most days but endorses frustration and anxiety around social situations due to repeated misunderstandings.\n\nSocial communication and interaction: He has difficulty with back-and-forth conversation and reciprocity; when asked about friends, he says, \"I have one person I text about games and schedules, but I don't really hang out.\" He reports limited interest in typical peer social activities and difficulty understanding social norms (e.g., when to ask questions, how to show interest). He describes longstanding challenges interpreting nonverbal cues: \"I don't know what faces mean\" and \"I can't tell if someone is bored unless they tell me.\" On mental status exam, his eye contact is fleeting and often directed toward the floor or an object in his hands; his facial expression is limited and his prosody is somewhat monotone. He has difficulty adjusting communication to context, speaking in a formal, overly detailed manner during the interview. He reports difficulty developing and maintaining relationships beyond highly structured settings, stating that unstructured social events are \"confusing\" and he tends to stand alone.\n\nRestricted/repetitive behaviors and interests: He demonstrates repetitive motor mannerisms, frequently rocking slightly in the chair and rubbing his fingertips together when discussing stressful topics; he reports doing this \"to feel even.\" He describes a strong need for routine and significant distress with changes: \"If my plan changes last minute, I can't think straight,\" citing an episode where a professor changed the order of presentations and he became overwhelmed and left the room. He reports rigid adherence to specific daily schedules (same route to campus, same meals) and becomes irritable when interrupted. He describes an intense, circumscribed interest in train timetables and transit maps since childhood, stating, \"I memorize the schedules and can tell you the rolling stock models by year.\" He acknowledges that he frequently redirects conversations to transit systems even when others are not interested.\n\nSensory features: He endorses sensory sensitivities since early childhood, especially to loud or unpredictable sounds (e.g., hand dryers, crowded cafeterias) and certain clothing textures. He states, \"The buzzing lights and sudden noises feel painful,\" and he often wears noise-canceling headphones in public spaces. He also reports being unusually selective about foods due to texture.\n\nDevelopmental history: Per mother (collateral obtained with patient consent), concerns were present in early childhood. He spoke his first words on time but used language in an \"adult-like\" way and tended to lecture about preferred topics. He rarely engaged in pretend play with other children and preferred lining up toy vehicles and sorting objects. He did not spontaneously point to share interest and seemed \"in his own world\" at times. In elementary school he had difficulty making friends, was often isolated at recess, and was described by teachers as highly intelligent but \"socially immature\" and \"rigid.\" He required predictable routines and had intense distress with changes (e.g., substitute teachers). There is no history suggestive of psychosis, manic episodes, or trauma-related re-experiencing. He denies current or past suicidal ideation.\n\nFunctional impairment: Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social and academic functioning. He has strong grades in technical courses but struggles with group projects, interviews, and workplace interactions. At his library job he performs well with solitary tasks but has been coached repeatedly about tone, greeting patrons, and adapting to unexpected requests.\n\nMedical/psychiatric history: No major medical illnesses. No history of seizures. Sleep is variable, often delayed due to \"getting stuck\" on organizing information online. No substance use. Family history notable for a paternal uncle described as socially withdrawn with narrow interests.\n\nMental status examination: Appearance neat; behavior cooperative but somewhat guarded; intermittent rocking and hand-fidgeting observed. Speech normal rate and volume with mildly monotone prosody; content is concrete and detail-focused. Mood \"okay\"; affect constricted. Thought process linear; no delusions or hallucinations. Cognition grossly intact; insight partial (recognizes difficulties but attributes them mainly to others being \"illogical\"). Judgment fair.\n\nSummary: A lifelong pattern of marked difficulty with social reciprocity, nonverbal communication, and developing/maintaining relationships is present, along with repetitive behaviors, rigidity, restricted interests, and sensory sensitivities, beginning in early development and causing significant functional impairment; presentation is not better accounted for by intellectual disability (he demonstrates average-to-above-average academic performance and intact basic adaptive skills) or another primary psychiatric disorder.",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \"I feel like I'm moving through wet cement. Nothing feels worth it anymore.\"\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient is a 38-year-old woman presenting for evaluation of low mood and functional decline for approximately 7\u20138 weeks. She reports feeling \"down and empty\" most of the day nearly every day, with a marked drop in interest and enjoyment in activities she previously found rewarding (reading novels, baking with her kids, and weekend walks). She states, \"Even when I have free time, I just stare at the wall or scroll on my phone and feel nothing.\" Symptoms began gradually after a workplace restructuring in which she was reassigned to a new manager and higher workload; she denies a single acute precipitating event. She reports significant impairment: missed two deadlines, has taken three sick days in the past month, and has been withdrawing socially.\n\nNeurovegetative symptoms: Sleep is fragmented with initial and middle insomnia (takes 1\u20132 hours to fall asleep, wakes around 3\u20134 a.m. and cannot return to sleep). She notes reduced appetite with an unintentional 8-lb weight loss over ~6 weeks. Energy is low: \"By noon, I feel spent.\" She describes psychomotor slowing noticed by her spouse: \"He says I talk slower and just sit there.\" Concentration is poor; she rereads emails repeatedly and feels \"foggy\" in meetings.\n\nCognitive/affective symptoms: She endorses frequent feelings of excessive guilt and self-criticism, stating, \"I'm failing at work and I'm not being the mom my kids deserve.\" She reports diminished self-worth and ruminative negative thoughts. She denies hallucinations or fixed false beliefs. Anxiety symptoms are present but secondary: she feels \"on edge\" much of the day, worries about making mistakes and being fired, and experiences occasional episodes of chest tightness and trembling lasting ~10 minutes when anticipating meetings; she has not avoided leaving home and denies fear of having attacks in public.\n\nSafety assessment: She reports passive thoughts such as \"Sometimes I think it would be easier not to wake up,\" occurring a few times per week, particularly at night. She denies intent, plan, preparatory behaviors, or access to firearms. She identifies protective factors including her children and spouse, stating, \"I would never do that to them.\" No history of suicide attempts or self-injury.\n\nPast psychiatric history: Similar, milder episode in her early 20s during college lasting several months that improved with counseling; she was never hospitalized. No history of elevated/expansive mood, decreased need for sleep with high energy, increased goal-directed activity, impulsive spending, or other periods suggestive of manic or hypomanic episodes. No prior psychotic symptoms.\n\nMedical history: Migraine headaches (intermittent), mild iron-deficiency anemia in the past. No known thyroid disease. Current medications: sumatriptan as needed for migraines; multivitamin. No corticosteroid use.\n\nSubstance use: Drinks 1\u20132 glasses of wine on most nights over the past month to \"shut my brain off,\" previously 1\u20132 drinks per week. Denies morning drinking, blackouts, withdrawal symptoms, or work-related consequences. Denies cannabis or other illicit substances. Caffeine: 2\u20133 cups coffee daily.\n\nFamily history: Mother with recurrent episodes of low mood treated with antidepressants; maternal uncle with alcohol misuse. No known bipolar disorder in first-degree relatives.\n\nSocial history: Married, describes relationship as generally supportive though strained by her withdrawal and irritability. Reports less patience with children: \"I snap and then I hate myself for it.\" Financial stress modest but present due to reduced bonuses at work.\n\nReview of systems (pertinent): Denies fever, night sweats, or new neurologic deficits. Endorses decreased libido. Denies pregnancy.\n\nMental status exam: Appearance mildly disheveled, limited eye contact. Behavior cooperative, slowed movements. Speech soft, slowed, reduced spontaneity. Mood \"numb and sad.\" Affect constricted, tearful at times. Thought process linear but ruminative. Thought content notable for worthlessness and passive death wishes without plan/intent. No perceptual disturbances. Cognition grossly intact; attention reduced on serial sevens. Insight and judgment fair.\n\nClinical summary: Presentation is characterized by persistent depressed mood and loss of interest with insomnia, appetite/weight loss, psychomotor slowing, fatigue, impaired concentration, excessive guilt/worthlessness, and passive suicidal ideation for >6 weeks causing clinically significant impairment. No evidence of manic/hypomanic episodes, primary psychotic disorder, or symptoms better explained by substances or a general medical condition based on current information; she is agreeable to basic labs (CBC, TSH) given weight loss and fatigue. Mild anxiety and increased alcohol use appear to be secondary/coping responses rather than primary drivers of the syndrome.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. A is a 34-year-old elementary school teacher presenting for evaluation due to persistent anxiety and ongoing worry that she describes as \"constant\" and \"hard to shut off.\" She reports that for the past 9\u201310 months she has worried on most days about multiple areas of her life, including her children\u2019s safety and health, her own health, finances, job performance, and the possibility of making mistakes at work. She states, \"Even when nothing is wrong, my mind finds something to worry about,\" and notes she spends hours mentally reviewing potential problems and imagining worst-case scenarios. She reports difficulty controlling the worry: \"I tell myself to stop, but it keeps going,\" and she feels compelled to check emails repeatedly and re-read lesson plans to reassure herself.\n\nShe endorses associated physical and cognitive symptoms occurring on most days during this period, including feeling keyed up and restless (\"I\u2019m on edge, like I can\u2019t relax\"), easy fatigability by afternoon despite adequate effort (\"I feel drained from worrying\"), difficulty concentrating (\"I read the same paragraph three times\"), irritability (\"I snap at my family more than I want to\"), muscle tension with frequent neck and shoulder tightness and tension headaches, and sleep disturbance characterized by trouble falling asleep due to racing thoughts and waking early to worry about the day. She denies discrete episodes of sudden terror with palpitations or fear of dying; instead, the anxiety is described as persistent and generalized. She denies intrusive unwanted images or repetitive rituals aimed at preventing catastrophe beyond reassurance-seeking and repeated checking of emails/lesson materials that she views as attempts to reduce worry rather than fixed, time-consuming compulsions.\n\nShe reports the symptoms have caused clinically significant distress and impairment: she spends excessive time preparing for work, has difficulty completing tasks efficiently, feels less patient with her children, and has reduced enjoyment of hobbies because she is \"always thinking about what could go wrong.\" She has missed two social gatherings in the past month because she felt too tense and preoccupied to attend.\n\nShe denies current or past periods of abnormally elevated mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, impulsive spending, or other symptoms suggestive of mania/hypomania. She denies hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized behavior. She denies persistent depressed mood or loss of interest most days; she reports that her mood is \"mostly anxious\" and that she can enjoy activities when worry is lower. She denies trauma-related flashbacks or avoidance linked to a specific traumatic event.\n\nMedical history is notable only for mild seasonal allergies. She denies thyroid disease and reports a normal physical exam and basic lab work within the last year per her primary care clinician. She is not taking stimulants, steroids, or other medications associated with anxiety. She drinks one cup of coffee in the morning and does not use energy drinks. She denies suicidal or homicidal ideation. Family history includes a mother described as \"a worrier\" with long-standing anxiety symptoms.\n\nOn mental status exam, she is cooperative, appropriately groomed, and mildly fidgety. Speech is normal rate and volume. Mood is \"anxious\" with congruent affect. Thought process is linear but ruminative. Thought content is notable for excessive worry about multiple everyday domains without psychotic features. Cognition is grossly intact, though she reports concentration difficulties.

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \"I feel like I'm always behind\u2014like everyone else has a system and I just don't.\"\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient presents for evaluation of long-standing difficulties with attention and organization that have become more impairing after a recent promotion requiring management of multiple projects and deadlines. She reports frequently losing track of tasks midstream, needing to reread emails several times, and missing details despite sincere effort. \"I'll open an email, start replying, then notice something else, then it's 45 minutes later and I never sent the reply.\" She describes chronic procrastination and last-minute \"panic productivity,\" often staying up late to complete work she intended to start earlier.\n\nAt work, she struggles to prioritize, forgets meeting action items unless she writes them down immediately, and has received feedback about inconsistent follow-through. She reports making avoidable errors (e.g., sending a draft with wrong attachments, overlooking a key line in a client brief). She describes an internal sense of restlessness during meetings and frequently checks her phone or doodles to stay engaged. \"If I just sit there, my mind drifts and I realize I missed the last five minutes.\" She reports interrupting colleagues at times and finishing others' sentences, then feeling embarrassed.\n\nAt home, she describes ongoing disorganization: piles of unopened mail, difficulty keeping track of bills, and frequently misplacing keys and headphones. Her partner notes she often starts household tasks and leaves them incomplete (e.g., half-unloaded dishwasher, laundry started but not folded). She reports that routine tasks requiring sustained mental effort, such as budgeting or filing insurance paperwork, feel \"physically painful\" to start and are often avoided until urgent.\n\nDevelopmental and longitudinal history: She reports similar patterns since childhood. She recalls being labeled \"smart but scattered\" by teachers, frequently forgetting homework, losing school supplies, and talking excessively in class. She states she could focus intensely on preferred activities (art projects, novels) but struggled to complete multi-step assignments. Her mother reportedly managed her schedule closely, which the patient believes \"covered up\" difficulties until she moved out. She denies a history of learning disability diagnosis but recalls needing extra time due to slow completion from distraction. Symptoms were present before age 12 per patient and collateral report (mother contacted with permission), and have persisted into adulthood.\n\nComorbidity/non-standard features: Over the past year, she has developed increased worry and tension related to performance at work, with intermittent insomnia (difficulty initiating sleep when ruminating about unfinished tasks). She describes occasional somatic anxiety (chest tightness, stomach \"knots\") before deadlines. She denies panic attacks, obsessive rituals, or traumatic flashbacks. Mood is described as \"frustrated\" rather than persistently depressed; she denies anhedonia most days, suicidal ideation, or episodes of elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, or risky spending. She reports episodic low self-esteem tied to perceived underachievement: \"I feel lazy, even though I'm exhausted.\"\n\nFunctional impairment: Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in occupational performance (missed deadlines, corrective feedback, extended work hours to compensate), home management (missed bill payments, clutter, incomplete chores), and relationship strain due to forgetfulness and perceived inattentiveness during conversations. She reports near-miss driving incidents involving distraction (e.g., missing an exit, not noticing a light change promptly) but no major accidents.\n\nSubstance/medical considerations: She consumes 2\u20133 cups of coffee/day and sometimes uses energy drinks when behind. She denies using non-prescribed stimulants. She sleeps 5\u20136 hours on weekdays due to delayed sleep onset; weekend sleep extends to 9\u201310 hours. No symptoms suggest thyroid disease; no current medications other than albuterol PRN.\n\nMental status exam (abbreviated): Well-groomed, cooperative. Speech normal rate/volume but tangential at times, requiring gentle redirection. Affect mildly anxious, reactive; mood \"stressed.\" Thought process generally linear with occasional circumstantiality when describing examples. No delusions/hallucinations. Cognition grossly intact; attention during interview variable\u2014she asks for repetition of a question once and checks her phone impulsively, apologizing. Insight and judgment fair.\n\nClinical impression: Presentation is characterized by persistent inattention (poor sustained attention, disorganization, forgetfulness, losing items, avoidance of sustained effort) with associated restlessness/impulsivity (difficulty sitting through meetings, interrupting) beginning in childhood, present across settings, and causing impairment. Anxiety symptoms appear largely secondary to chronic performance difficulties and deadline pressure rather than constituting the primary syndrome.",

It\u2019s like I\u2019m still there.\u201d\n\nHistory of present concerns:\nThe patient presents for evaluation 8 months after responding to a multi-alarm apartment building fire during an overnight shift. She reports being among the first responders inside the building, encountering multiple deceased occupants including children, and performing prolonged recovery/extrication efforts while hearing family members outside screaming. She describes believing at the time that the structure could collapse and that she might die. She denies head injury or loss of consciousness.\n\nSince that call, she reports recurrent, unwanted memories that \u201chit me out of nowhere\u201d several times per week, often triggered by the smell of smoke or overhearing certain alarms. She describes vivid nightmares 2\u20133 nights per week: \u201cI\u2019m carrying a kid and they\u2019re ash in my arms.\u201d She endorses episodes at work where she feels momentarily as if she is back inside the building (\u201cIt\u2019s like the hallway is that hallway again\u201d), accompanied by racing heart, sweating, and shaking; she has started stepping outside to ground herself and \u201ccount objects\u201d until the sensation passes.\n\nAvoidance:\nShe has been actively avoiding reminders. She has switched shifts to reduce exposure to fire calls, asks partners to handle anything involving burnt structures, and avoids driving past the neighborhood where the incident occurred. She stopped watching news footage of fires and refuses to attend departmental debriefing events: \u201cIf people start talking about it, I feel sick and I\u2019m gone.\u201d She reports trying not to think about the event, keeping herself constantly busy with chores and online \u201cprep checklists,\u201d and becoming distressed when others ask about that night.\n\nMood/cognition changes:\nShe endorses persistent negative emotions (fear, guilt, shame) and a belief that she \u201cshould have done more,\u201d despite colleagues telling her there was nothing else possible. She describes feeling detached from others: \u201cEveryone\u2019s joking at the station and I\u2019m behind glass.\u201d She reports reduced interest in previously enjoyed activities (going out with friends, group fitness classes) and has been withdrawing socially. She also reports difficulty experiencing positive emotions: \u201cEven when something good happens, it doesn\u2019t land.\u201d She endorses new mistrust and vigilance in public places (\u201cI\u2019m always scanning exits\u201d), and recurrent thoughts that the world is unsafe.\n\nArousal/reactivity:\nShe reports sleep disturbance (difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings), irritability (\u201cI snap at my partner over nothing\u201d), and concentration problems that interfere with charting. She describes being easily startled by sudden noises, especially alarms, and states that she now keeps her home \u201cset up in a certain way\u201d so she can move quickly if something happens (shoes lined up, bag packed, doors double-checked). She reports hypervigilance in crowds and restaurants, preferring to sit facing the door. She notes that she has become very sensitive to certain sounds and textures since the incident (sirens, smoke smell, \u201cscratchy\u201d clothing), describing them as \u201ctoo loud\u201d or \u201citchy\u201d and leading to immediate agitation.\n\nFeatures creating diagnostic ambiguity:\nOver the last several months she has begun appearing \u201crigid\u201d in routines and has reduced eye contact in sessions, often looking down or to the side when discussing emotionally charged material. She reports preferring solitary tasks, becoming overwhelmed in noisy group settings at the station, and focusing intensely on organizing equipment and emergency-preparedness lists. Her partner describes her as \u201cdifferent\u2014more closed off, more literal, and easily overloaded.\u201d However, the patient and partner both report that before the fire she was comfortable with socializing, handled workplace banter well, maintained friendships, and did not have longstanding patterns of social-communication difficulty or lifelong restricted interests. The current social narrowing and routinization are described as beginning after the fire and fluctuating with trigger exposure and sleep.\n\nFunctional impact:\nShe has used increasing sick days, requested reassignment away from certain calls, and received feedback about slowed documentation and irritability with coworkers. At home, she avoids gatherings, argues more with her partner, and reports diminished intimacy. She states, \u201cI\u2019m not myself, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to lose my job.\u201d\n\nRisk and safety:\nShe denies current suicidal intent or plan. She endorses occasional passive thoughts such as \u201cI wish I could disappear for a while\u201d during nights of poor sleep, without intent, preparatory behaviors, or prior attempts. Denies homicidal ideation. No access to firearms. Denies hallucinations outside of brief episodes of feeling \u201cback there\u201d when triggered; she recognizes these episodes as related to the event.\n\nSubstances/medical:\nShe reports increased alcohol use to \u201cnumb out and fall asleep,\u201d denies morning drinking or withdrawal symptoms. No stimulant use. No symptoms suggesting thyroid disease or seizure disorder. No current intoxication observed.\n\nMental status examination (at intake):\nAppearance neat, dressed in work attire; psychomotor mildly tense. Speech normal rate/volume; becomes clipped when discussing the fire. Mood \u201con edge\u201d; affect constricted, anxious, tearful when describing specific images. Thought process linear. Thought content notable for guilt and fear; no delusions. Perception: no persistent perceptual disturbances; reports brief triggered episodes of reliving. Cognition: oriented, attention mildly impaired by anxiety. Insight and judgment intact. Rapport: cooperative but guarded; eye contact intermittent, improves when discussing neutral topics.\n\nClinical impression summary (without naming a specific disorder):\nPresentation is characterized by persistent trauma-related intrusions (memories, nightmares, brief reliving), active avoidance of reminders and related conversations, negative shifts in mood/cognitions (guilt, detachment, diminished interest, inability to feel positive emotions), and heightened arousal/reactivity (hypervigilance, startle, irritability, sleep and concentration problems), beginning after a life-threatening, gruesome occupational exposure and persisting for months with clear occupational and relational impairment. Social withdrawal, sensory overload, and increased reliance on routines appear temporally linked to the traumatic exposure and are not described as lifelong traits.",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \u201cI\u2019m exhausted from pretending to be normal at work. After meetings I feel like my brain is buzzing.\u201d\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient presents for evaluation of longstanding social and occupational difficulties that have become more impairing after a recent promotion requiring increased collaboration, open-ended problem solving, and frequent video meetings. She reports she can perform technical tasks \u201calmost perfectly\u201d but struggles with unstructured social demands: \u201cI never know when it\u2019s my turn to talk. I either talk too much about details or I go silent.\u201d She describes routinely rehearsing conversations beforehand and replaying interactions afterward for hours, worried she sounded \u201crude\u201d or \u201cweird.\u201d She reports difficulty picking up indirect requests and sarcasm unless explicitly signaled: \u201cIf someone says \u2018It\u2019s chilly in here,\u2019 I don\u2019t know if they want me to close the window unless they say it directly.\u201d She notes others have told her she sounds \u201cflat\u201d or \u201ctoo formal,\u201d and she often relies on learned scripts in customer-facing situations.\n\nSocial communication and interaction: She describes limited social reciprocity and difficulty sustaining back-and-forth conversations outside structured topics. In session, she provides highly detailed answers about workflow and product specifications, but needs redirection when asked about feelings or interpersonal nuances. She reports she often misses subtle facial expressions and tends to interpret language literally, leading to misunderstandings. She describes discomfort with eye contact (\u201cIt feels like looking into a spotlight; I can do it for a few seconds but then I lose my train of thought\u201d) and states she consciously monitors her facial expressions in public. She reports few close friendships and prefers one-on-one interactions with clear shared activities. She is currently not dating; past relationships ended due to partners perceiving her as \u201cdistant\u201d or \u201cnot affectionate enough,\u201d while she felt overwhelmed by frequent texting and spontaneous plans. She reports she wants connection but finds group dynamics confusing: \u201cIt\u2019s like everyone got a rulebook I never received.\u201d\n\nRestricted/repetitive behaviors and interests: She reports long-standing intense interests that she pursues with high focus and pleasure. Currently she spends most evenings cataloging public transit routes and service changes in multiple cities, creating spreadsheets and maps; she describes this as calming and \u201cthe only time my mind is quiet.\u201d She acknowledges talking about this topic at length even when others appear disengaged and has been told she \u201cinfo-dumps.\u201d She reports rigid routines around morning and bedtime and becomes distressed with unexpected changes: \u201cIf my schedule gets shifted, I feel panicky and can\u2019t start anything.\u201d She describes repetitive behaviors under stress, including finger tapping, rocking subtly in her chair, and rubbing a textured keychain in her pocket; she notes she suppresses these in public but feels \u201cwound up\u201d when she does.\n\nSensory features: She reports sensory sensitivities since childhood, particularly to certain sounds (chewing, pen clicking, fluorescent light hum) and clothing textures (tags, seams). She avoids some social settings due to noise and unpredictable sensory input, stating: \u201cRestaurants feel like being trapped inside a speaker.\u201d She also reports strong preference for specific foods due to texture and becomes nauseated with \u201cmushy\u201d foods.\n\nDevelopmental history: She reports being described as an \u201cearly reader\u201d and academically strong, especially in math and factual learning. Her mother reportedly said she was \u201ca quiet baby\u201d who preferred playing alone and became intensely upset with changes in routine. As a child, she engaged in repetitive play (lining up toys by size/color) and would talk at length about specific interests (trains, weather patterns). She recalls being teased in school for being \u201crobotic\u201d and not understanding social rules. She denies a history of language delay; she reports she spoke early but was \u201cpedantic\u201d and used unusually formal vocabulary. She recalls frequent meltdowns at home after school, described as crying and yelling when overwhelmed by noise and social demands.\n\nCurrent functioning and impairment: She is employed and has consistently good performance reviews for accuracy and reliability, but reports significant distress and fatigue from increased interpersonal demands. She has recently started avoiding team lunches and optional meetings, and she worries her anxiety and shutdowns will jeopardize her job. She reports episodes of becoming nonverbal or \u201cblank\u201d during conflict or rapid back-and-forth discussions: \u201cI can\u2019t find words, and it\u2019s like my body freezes.\u201d She notes difficulty with executive functioning during disruptions\u2014missing meals, losing track of time, and failing to transition between tasks unless she uses timers and checklists.\n\nComorbid symptoms (mild, non-primary): She reports generalized anxiety symptoms that spike around social evaluation and changes in routine, including muscle tension, restlessness, and insomnia before presentations. She reports intermittent low mood and reduced interest over the past two months related to workplace stress, without anhedonia most days, suicidality, or psychotic symptoms. She denies manic symptoms. She denies substance use disorder; drinks alcohol rarely.\n\nMental status exam (abbreviated): Well-groomed; cooperative. Speech fluent, sometimes overly detailed and formal; prosody mildly monotone. Affect constricted but congruent; mood \u201cstressed.\u201d Thought process linear though circumstantial at times. No delusions/hallucinations. Insight fair; judgment intact. Notable discomfort with direct eye contact; uses occasional scripted phrases and checks notes during the interview.\n\nRisk and safety: Denies current or past suicidal ideation, self-harm, or homicidal ideation.\n\nSummary: Lifelong pattern of atypical social communication (difficulty with reciprocal conversation, pragmatic language, interpreting indirect cues, reduced comfort with eye contact and social signaling) and restricted/repetitive patterns (intense narrow interests, sensory sensitivities, repetitive self-soothing movements, and distress with changes), present since early childhood and currently causing clinically significant distress and functional impairment, especially in work and relationships, with mild anxiety and situational low mood as secondary concerns.",

    "clinical_text": "The patient presents for evaluation of worsening mood and functioning over the past 7\u20138 weeks. He reports feeling \"down most of the day, almost every day\" with a marked loss of interest in activities he previously enjoyed (coaching basketball, woodworking, and socializing with colleagues). He states, \"Even when I have free time, I just sit there. Nothing feels worth doing.\" He describes persistent fatigue and low motivation, saying he has been \"dragging\" himself to work and has started missing optional school events he previously attended.\n\nSleep has been disturbed with early-morning awakening (waking around 3\u20134 a.m. and unable to return to sleep), resulting in daytime exhaustion. Appetite has decreased with an unintentional 10-lb weight loss over approximately two months. He endorses impaired concentration and indecisiveness at work: \"I reread the same email five times and still don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying.\" His spouse reports he is more withdrawn and slower in his movements and speech; the patient agrees, stating, \"It takes effort to answer basic questions.\" He endorses feelings of excessive guilt and worthlessness disproportionate to circumstances: \"I\u2019m letting my students down. I\u2019m a bad husband. They\u2019d be better off without me.\" He denies any history of periods of elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, increased goal-directed activity, or risky behavior.\n\nHe reports intermittent passive thoughts of death, such as, \"Sometimes I think it would be easier if I didn\u2019t wake up,\" and on two occasions has thought about \"driving off the road,\" but denies a plan, intent, preparatory behaviors, or access to firearms. He identifies his children as a strong protective factor and agrees to safety planning and to involve his spouse in monitoring.\n\nThe patient initially links the onset of his decline to a school incident approximately two months ago when the campus went into a brief lockdown due to a report of a weapon in the neighborhood; the report was later found to be unfounded and there was no direct confrontation or injury. Since then, he reports feeling more generally \"shaken\" and describes being tense when hearing loud hallway noises or alarms at school. However, he denies recurrent, involuntary, intrusive memories of the event, denies flashbacks or feeling as if the event is happening again, and denies trauma-related nightmares; he notes that his sleep difficulty is \"more like my mind is stuck on everything I\u2019m failing at\" rather than replaying the lockdown. He is not avoiding the school, his classroom, or related reminders; he continues to work daily and states, \"I don\u2019t dread the building itself\u2014I dread facing people because I feel ashamed.\" He denies persistent hypervigilance specific to threat (e.g., scanning for danger) and denies significant exaggerated startle response beyond \"being tired and irritable.\" He does endorse irritability and reduced patience at home, which he attributes to poor sleep and low mood. There is no report of dissociative symptoms, significant memory gaps around the incident, or persistent fear-based symptoms tied to reminders.\n\nPast psychiatric history is notable for a brief episode of depressed mood in his early 20s after a breakup that resolved without treatment. No prior suicide attempts. Family history: mother with recurrent depression treated successfully with medication. Medical history: hypertension controlled with lisinopril; no thyroid disease; no recent infections; no head injury. He denies recent corticosteroid use. Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.\n\nOn mental status examination, he is cooperative, dressed appropriately, with downcast gaze. Psychomotor activity is mildly slowed. Speech is soft with decreased spontaneity. Mood is \"empty\"; affect is constricted and tearful at times. Thought process is linear but slowed, with prominent self-critical ruminations. No delusions or hallucinations. He is fully oriented. Attention is impaired on serial sevens due to distractibility. Insight and judgment are fair. He agrees to follow-up, therapy referral, and discussion of medication options. Recent basic labs performed by his primary care clinician (CBC, CMP, TSH, B12) were reportedly within normal limits.",

    "clinical_text": "A 34-year-old woman presents to an outpatient psychiatry clinic for evaluation of persistent anxiety and \u201cconstant worrying\u201d that has been present most days for the past 10\u201312 months. She reports worry occurring across multiple areas of life, including work performance, finances, her child\u2019s health and safety, and the possibility of making minor mistakes. She states, \u201cMy mind is always running worst-case scenarios,\u201d and \u201cEven when something is going well, I start thinking about what could go wrong.\u201d She describes the worry as difficult to control: \u201cI tell myself to stop and I can\u2019t\u2014my brain just keeps spinning.\u201d\n\nShe reports that the anxiety is present on most days and lasts for hours at a time, often worsening in the evenings. She endorses associated symptoms including feeling keyed up and on edge (\u201cI\u2019m tense all the time\u201d), easy fatigue (\u201cI\u2019m exhausted by mid-afternoon\u201d), difficulty concentrating (\u201cI reread the same email three times and still feel unsure\u201d), irritability (\u201cI snap at my partner over small things\u201d), muscle tension (notably neck and shoulder tightness with frequent jaw clenching), and sleep disturbance (trouble falling asleep due to rumination and waking during the night thinking about tasks). She denies discrete episodes of sudden, intense fear with palpitations or a sense of impending doom; instead, her anxiety is described as sustained and diffuse.\n\nThe symptoms have caused clinically significant distress and impairment. At work, she spends excessive time checking her work and seeking reassurance from coworkers, leading to missed deadlines. At home, she reports reduced patience with her family and avoidance of relaxing activities because she feels she \u201cshould be doing something productive.\u201d She has tried to manage symptoms with exercise and limiting caffeine, with only partial benefit.\n\nShe denies persistent low mood, anhedonia, or suicidal ideation. She denies intrusive unwanted thoughts with compulsive rituals, flashbacks or nightmares related to trauma, social fear focused on scrutiny, and specific phobias. There is no history of manic or hypomanic episodes. She denies hallucinations or delusional beliefs.\n\nMedical history is notable only for mild seasonal allergies. She is not pregnant. Current medications include an occasional antihistamine. She denies use of illicit substances. Alcohol use is limited to 1\u20132 drinks on weekends without escalation; she denies withdrawal symptoms. She drinks 1 cup of coffee daily and has reduced intake due to feeling jittery. Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable. She reports no symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism (no heat intolerance, unexplained weight loss, or persistent tremor). She has not had recent major medical illness.\n\nOn mental status examination, she is punctual, cooperative, and appropriately groomed. She appears tense, frequently wrings her hands, and describes her mood as \u201canxious.\u201d Affect is anxious but congruent, with full range. Thought process is linear; thought content is notable for excessive worry about multiple everyday domains without psychotic features. She is alert and fully oriented. Attention is mildly impaired during the interview when discussing work stressors. Insight and judgment are intact.\n\nOverall, her presentation is characterized by excessive, pervasive worry occurring more days than not for well over six months, difficulty controlling the worry, multiple associated physical and cognitive symptoms, and functional impairment, not attributable to substances, a medical condition, or another primary mental disorder.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. R is a 24-year-old graduate student referred for longstanding difficulties with attention, organization, and restlessness that are now causing significant academic and occupational impairment. She reports that she has \"always been like this,\" but the increased volume of reading, independent project work, and multiple deadlines in graduate school have made symptoms more disruptive.\n\nShe describes persistent problems with sustained attention: \"I\u2019ll read the same page three times and still not know what I read.\" In seminars, she often loses track of discussions and later realizes she missed key points. When her supervisor gives multi-step instructions, she says she \"zones out halfway through\" and then feels embarrassed to ask for repetition. She frequently makes careless mistakes in data entry and writing assignments (e.g., missing obvious formatting requirements, submitting files with incomplete sections) despite understanding the material. She reports frequent forgetfulness in daily activities, including missing meetings unless she sets multiple alarms, forgetting to respond to important emails, and leaving tasks unfinished even when she intended to complete them.\n\nShe endorses prominent disorganization and poor time management. She describes her workspace and computer files as \"a mess\" and says she often cannot find documents she saved. She struggles to break down larger assignments, starts late, and then stays up all night rushing to finish. She has missed two research assistant deadlines in the past month and received a warning from her supervisor. She reports avoiding tasks requiring sustained mental effort, stating, \"I know I need to do the literature review, but I keep putting it off because it feels unbearable.\" She frequently loses items such as keys, earbuds, and ID badges and reports she is easily distracted by background noises, phone notifications, or unrelated thoughts: \"If someone walks by or my phone buzzes, I\u2019m gone.\" \n\nIn addition to inattention, she reports a chronic sense of internal restlessness. She fidgets during classes, taps her foot, and changes posture repeatedly. She finds it difficult to remain seated for long lectures and often chooses seats near the aisle so she can step out. She describes feeling \"driven by a motor\" when trying to relax and says she interrupts her roommate during conversations, finishing sentences or blurting out ideas: \"I don\u2019t mean to, it just comes out.\" She notices impatience in lines and has difficulty waiting her turn in group discussions.\n\nSymptoms began in childhood and were present well before age 12. She recalls teachers commenting that she was bright but \"daydreamed,\" forgot homework, and had a messy desk and backpack. She reports her parents frequently had to prompt her to complete chores and assignments and that she often misplaced school materials. She states these difficulties continued through middle and high school; she relied on last-minute cramming and frequent reminders and was known for being \"scatterbrained\" despite good test performance.\n\nSymptoms occur across multiple settings. She reports significant difficulties at school (missed deadlines, inconsistent studying, poor follow-through) and at work (missed tasks, errors, needing repeated instructions). At home, she describes chronic clutter, unpaid bills unless she sets reminders, and conflicts with her roommate due to forgetting shared responsibilities. She reports clear functional impairment, including a recent drop in grades, increased academic stress, and concerns about losing her research assistant position.\n\nShe denies current or past episodes of abnormally elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, or impulsive high-risk behavior suggestive of a manic or hypomanic episode. She denies persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, suicidal ideation, hallucinations, or paranoia. She reports situational anxiety related to performance and deadlines but states the primary issue is \"I can\u2019t keep my attention on what I\u2019m supposed to do.\" She denies alcohol or drug misuse and reports minimal caffeine intake. Sleep is variable mainly due to procrastination-related late nights rather than insomnia; appetite is stable. There is no history of head injury, seizures, or other neurologic illness. \n\nOn mental status examination, she is cooperative and engaged. Speech is normal in rate and volume though occasionally rapid when excited. Mood is \"stressed\" with congruent affect. Thought process is linear. She is easily distracted by hallway noise and checks her phone once during the interview, apologizing. No psychotic features are observed. Insight and judgment are intact. Overall presentation is consistent with a persistent pattern of inattention and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms beginning in childhood, present across settings, and causing clinically significant impairment.",

She endorses persistent guilt and self-blame, stating, \u201cI should have done something different\u2014if I were better at my job, he\u2019d be alive,\u201d despite colleagues reassuring her that the injuries were unsurvivable. She describes a negative worldview (\u201cThe world is unsafe; anything can happen at any moment\u201d) and diminished interest in previously enjoyed activities (she stopped running with her group and no longer meets friends for dinner). She feels detached from others, saying, \u201cI\u2019m there but not really there,\u201d and reports difficulty experiencing positive emotions: \u201cEven when something good happens, it doesn\u2019t register.\u201d She notes patchy memory for parts of the event, describing gaps around the moment of death and immediate aftermath.\n\nShe also endorses persistent hyperarousal symptoms. She has difficulty falling and staying asleep, is irritable and \u201csnaps\u201d at coworkers, and has difficulty concentrating during charting. She is hypervigilant in public settings (sits facing exits, scans for danger) and has an exaggerated startle response to sudden noises. She reports intermittent reckless driving when anxious (\u201cI just need to get away and I speed without thinking\u201d), which she recognizes as out of character.\n\nSymptoms have been present for more than 6 months and cause clinically significant impairment: she has called out of work repeatedly, received a warning for declining certain calls, and reports strained relationships and social withdrawal. She denies current or past manic episodes, psychotic symptoms, or panic attacks unrelated to reminders of the event. She denies suicidal intent or plan but admits to occasional passive thoughts such as \u201cI wish I could just not wake up,\u201d especially after nightmares. She denies substance misuse; drinks 1\u20132 beers on weekends and has not increased use. Medical review is unremarkable; she is not taking sedatives or stimulants. She is seeking help because \u201cI can\u2019t keep functioning like this\u201d and fears she will lose her job.",

    "clinical_text": "A 24-year-old man is referred by his primary care clinician for long-standing social and communication difficulties and marked rigidity that are causing workplace and interpersonal problems. He reports that he has always felt \u201cout of sync with people\u201d and that social interactions feel like \u201ca script I never got.\u201d He describes wanting friends but not knowing how to initiate or maintain relationships: \u201cI can talk about work tasks, but small talk is confusing. I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s my turn, and people say I\u2019m blunt.\u201d He often misses implied meaning and sarcasm, stating, \u201cIf you want me to do something, just say it. Hints don\u2019t register.\u201d\n\nAt work, supervisors note he is technically strong but struggles with collaboration. He rarely makes eye contact during meetings, keeps his gaze on a laptop or the wall, and gives minimal facial expression. He reports difficulty reading others\u2019 emotions: \u201cI can\u2019t tell if someone is annoyed unless they say it.\u201d Coworkers have complained that he talks at length about specific software bugs and test coverage even when others attempt to change the topic. He acknowledges, \u201cWhen I\u2019m focused on a problem, I can\u2019t stop explaining it until it\u2019s complete.\u201d\n\nHe describes a lifelong pattern of restricted interests and intense focus. Since adolescence he has spent many hours daily cataloging public transit routes and schedules; he maintains detailed spreadsheets and becomes visibly excited when discussing route changes. He states, \u201cI can tell you every stop and transfer option in the city.\u201d Attempts by others to redirect the conversation are usually unsuccessful, and he reports becoming frustrated when people \u201cdon\u2019t want the details.\u201d\n\nHe also reports repetitive behaviors and sensory differences. When anxious or concentrating, he rocks slightly in his chair and repeatedly taps his fingers in a fixed pattern. He describes needing certain routines to feel settled: \u201cIf my morning sequence changes, my whole day is off.\u201d He becomes distressed by unexpected schedule changes, including last-minute meeting time shifts, and he may respond with irritability and withdrawal. Sensory sensitivities are prominent: he avoids fluorescent lighting and crowded cafeterias due to noise, saying \u201cthe sound feels like it\u2019s drilling into my head,\u201d and he wears the same soft clothing because certain fabrics feel \u201cscratchy and unbearable.\u201d\n\nDevelopmental history from the patient and his mother is consistent with symptoms beginning early in childhood. He spoke his first words around the typical age but was described as \u201ctalking like a little adult,\u201d with unusually formal language. In elementary school he preferred playing alone, lined up toy cars by size and color, and became upset if siblings moved them. He had difficulty with pretend play and often repeated lines from movies verbatim. Teachers noted he was quiet, socially isolated, and \u201cwould lecture about his favorite topics.\u201d He had chronic difficulty understanding peer rules of interaction and was frequently bullied. Despite strong academic performance, he required support for group projects because he could not negotiate roles and became upset when others did not follow his plans.\n\nCurrently, he has one online acquaintance but no in-person friends. He reports dating attempts ended because partners said he was \u201cemotionally distant\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t notice their feelings.\u201d He denies loss of interest, sustained low mood, manic symptoms, hallucinations, or delusional beliefs. Sleep and appetite are generally stable, though he becomes tense and irritable during periods of change or sensory overload. He denies suicidal or homicidal ideation. There is no history of traumatic brain injury or substance misuse.\n\nMental status examination: Well-groomed, cooperative but somewhat guarded; speech is fluent with normal rate and volume but unusually formal and overly detailed, with occasional tangential elaboration on preferred topics. Affect is restricted; mood described as \u201cfine, just stressed by people.\u201d Eye contact is limited; gestures are sparse. Thought process is logical but highly concrete, with difficulty interpreting hypothetical social scenarios. No psychosis. Cognition grossly intact; he demonstrates strong rote memory and attention to detail. Insight is partial (recognizes social difficulties but attributes them mainly to others \u201cnot being precise\u201d).\n\nOverall presentation is characterized by persistent difficulties in social reciprocity, nonverbal communication, and developing/maintaining relationships, alongside repetitive behaviors, insistence on sameness, circumscribed interests, and sensory hypersensitivity. These features have been present since early development and cause clinically significant impairment in occupational teamwork and social functioning. Intellectual functioning appears at least average, and there is no evidence that the presentation is better accounted for by a primary psychotic disorder, mood disorder, or global intellectual disability.",

She reports that for the past 7 weeks she has felt \"down and empty most of the day, every day\" and states, \"Nothing feels enjoyable anymore\u2014not even reading or going out with my friends.\" She describes markedly decreased motivation at work, needing extra time to complete lesson planning, and has taken several sick days because she \"can\u2019t make myself get out of bed.\" She notes a significant reduction in appetite with an unintentional 10-lb (4.5-kg) weight loss over the past month. Sleep is disrupted with early-morning awakenings; she sleeps 4\u20135 hours nightly and cannot return to sleep. She endorses persistent fatigue and low energy, stating, \"Even small tasks feel exhausting.\" She reports feeling slowed down and says her spouse has noticed she \"moves and talks more slowly.\" She also describes diminished concentration and indecisiveness: \"I reread the same email three times and still can\u2019t focus.\" She endorses excessive guilt and feelings of worthlessness, saying, \"I\u2019m a terrible teacher and my students deserve better,\" despite historically strong performance evaluations.\n\nShe reports recurrent thoughts that she would be \"better off not waking up,\" occurring several times per week over the past two weeks. She denies a specific plan or intent and denies access to firearms; she agrees to seek help if these thoughts intensify. She denies any history of suicide attempts or self-injury.\n\nThe symptoms began without a clear acute medical trigger; she denies recent infection, head injury, or new medications. She denies symptoms suggestive of thyroid disease (no heat/cold intolerance, palpitations, or hair changes). She is not pregnant and is not postpartum. She denies alcohol misuse and denies use of stimulants, opioids, or other substances. She denies any past episodes of abnormally elevated or irritable mood, decreased need for sleep with high energy, racing thoughts, impulsive spending, increased goal-directed activity, or other periods consistent with manic or hypomanic episodes. She denies hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia.\n\nOn mental status examination, she appears her stated age with fair grooming. Behavior is cooperative but slowed; psychomotor activity is mildly decreased. Speech is soft with reduced rate. Mood is described as \"sad\"; affect is constricted and tearful at times. Thought process is linear; thought content is notable for self-critical rumination and passive death wishes without plan or intent. No perceptual disturbances are observed. She is alert and fully oriented. Attention is reduced on serial sevens; memory is grossly intact. Insight and judgment are fair.\n\nOverall, symptoms have been present most days for more than two weeks, represent a change from her baseline, and are causing clinically significant impairment in occupational functioning and social withdrawal.",

She reports worry occurring more days than not and spanning multiple domains, including work performance (missing deadlines, being criticized, losing her job), finances (unexpected bills, not saving enough), her child\u2019s health and safety (accidents, illnesses), and her own health (misinterpreting benign sensations as signs of serious illness). She states, \u201cEven when nothing is wrong, my brain is looking for the next problem,\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t turn it off.\u201d She finds the worry difficult to control despite reassurance from family and coworkers.\n\nShe endorses associated symptoms present on most days: feeling keyed up/on edge (\u201cI\u2019m tense all the time\u201d), easy fatigability (\u201cI\u2019m exhausted by mid-afternoon even if the day isn\u2019t hard\u201d), difficulty concentrating (\u201cI read the same email three times and still don\u2019t absorb it\u201d), irritability (\u201csmall things set me off and then I feel guilty\u201d), muscle tension (especially shoulders/neck with frequent headaches), and sleep disturbance (takes 60\u201390 minutes to fall asleep due to ruminative thoughts; wakes early several times per week). She notes these symptoms worsen during busy work periods but remain present even during calmer weeks.\n\nThe anxiety and physical tension are causing clinically significant distress and impairment: she reports decreased productivity at work due to overchecking and reassurance-seeking (re-reading messages repeatedly, asking coworkers to confirm tasks), reduced enjoyment of time with her family, and avoidance of making routine decisions (\u201cI put off simple choices because I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll mess it up\u201d). She has increased sick days over the past two months due to headaches and poor sleep.\n\nShe denies discrete episodes of abrupt surges of intense fear with palpitations, choking sensations, or fear of dying. She does not report compulsive rituals, intrusive unwanted images, or time-consuming behaviors performed to neutralize obsessions. She denies traumatic event\u2013related flashbacks or nightmares. She reports no persistent low mood most of the day nearly every day; she denies anhedonia, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation. She denies periods of elevated/expansive mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, pressured speech, or risky behavior. She denies psychotic symptoms.\n\nMedical history is notable only for mild seasonal allergies. She takes an over-the-counter antihistamine as needed; no steroids or stimulants. She denies recent weight changes, heat intolerance, tremor, or other symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism. Basic labs from a recent primary care visit (including thyroid studies per her report) were normal. She denies pregnancy.\n\nMental status examination: well-groomed, cooperative, mildly fidgety with tense posture. Speech normal rate and volume.

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \u201cMy brain won\u2019t stay on one track. I\u2019m always behind, and people think I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient presents for evaluation due to longstanding difficulties with sustained attention, organization, and restlessness that have become more impairing after a promotion requiring more self-directed project management. She reports frequently starting tasks with strong intent but \u201cdrifting within minutes,\u201d especially during unstructured work. She describes reading the same paragraph repeatedly, losing her place in documents, and realizing she has missed key parts of meetings despite trying to pay attention: \u201cI\u2019ll look like I\u2019m listening, but I suddenly notice I caught nothing the last two minutes.\u201d She often makes avoidable mistakes in reports due to skipped steps, stating she \u201cmoves too fast and misses the obvious.\u201d\n\nShe endorses chronic disorganization: overdue reimbursements, missed appointment times, and difficulty sequencing multistep tasks (e.g., \u201cI\u2019ll open ten tabs, then jump between them, and none of it is done\u201d). She relies heavily on reminders and her partner for \u201ccalendar checks.\u201d She often misplaces essentials (badge, headphones, keys) and reports that her workspace and home \u201caccumulate piles\u201d despite repeated attempts to declutter. She avoids tasks requiring sustained mental effort unless under urgent deadline pressure, noting a pattern of \u201call-nighters fueled by panic.\u201d\n\nShe also describes prominent restlessness and impulsive speech. During meetings, she fidgets, taps her foot, changes sitting positions, and feels \u201cphysically uncomfortable\u201d when expected to remain still. She frequently interrupts or finishes others\u2019 sentences, then feels embarrassed: \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude; the thought just comes out.\u201d She reports difficulty waiting her turn in conversations and in lines, with internal impatience: \u201cI feel it in my chest\u2014like I have to move.\u201d She makes occasional impulsive purchases and has a history of switching hobbies quickly, though she denies high-risk spending, legal problems, or sustained periods of elevated mood.\n\nOverlapping/diagnostic challenge features: She reports that coworkers sometimes perceive her as \u201cblunt\u201d or \u201cnot reading the room,\u201d and she worries about seeming socially awkward. She describes missing parts of conversations and then responding off-topic, which has led to misunderstandings: \u201cPeople think I ignored what they said, but I genuinely didn\u2019t register it.\u201d She occasionally takes feedback literally when anxious and distracted. However, she reports enjoying social connection, seeking friendships, and generally understanding humor, sarcasm, and others\u2019 emotions when she is attentive. Her partner states she is warm and empathic but \u201cscattered\u201d and prone to zoning out. The patient describes good reciprocal conversation in one-on-one settings, appropriate eye contact, and an ability to adjust her communication style across contexts (work vs. friends vs. family). She denies a history of restricted, repetitive behaviors, stereotyped movements, insistence on sameness beyond ordinary preference, or circumscribed interests that dominate her life. She reports varied interests over time rather than narrowly fixed ones. Childhood history does not suggest persistent deficits in social reciprocity: she had friends, engaged in pretend play, and participated in group activities, though she was frequently labeled \u201cchatty,\u201d \u201cdaydreamy,\u201d and \u201cforgetful.\u201d\n\nDevelopmental and academic history: Symptoms were present by early elementary school per patient and parent collateral. She recalls being repeatedly redirected for talking, leaving her seat, and \u201cspacing out.\u201d Report cards noted \u201cdoes not finish classwork,\u201d \u201closes materials,\u201d and \u201cbright but inconsistent.\u201d She performed well on tests but struggled with long-term assignments and timed work, frequently completing projects at the last minute. She denies early language delay and met developmental milestones on time. She reports being socially engaged as a child, with a stable friend group, though she sometimes annoyed peers by interrupting or dominating conversations.\n\nFunctional impairment across settings: At work, she has received feedback about missed details, inconsistent follow-through, and late deliverables despite strong ideas and interpersonal skills. At home, she forgets chores, leaves tasks half-finished (e.g., laundry moved but not folded), and struggles with routine maintenance. In her relationship, conflict centers on inattention (e.g., \u201cI\u2019ll say \u2018uh-huh\u2019 and later realize I didn\u2019t actually hear her\u201d), misplacing shared items, and last-minute scrambling. She reports driving is generally safe but she is prone to missing turns and \u201cautopilot\u201d episodes, especially when tired.\n\nMood, anxiety, and sleep: She describes secondary anxiety related to performance and chronic lateness (\u201cI\u2019m constantly bracing for what I forgot\u201d). She denies panic attacks, compulsions, or trauma re-experiencing symptoms. Mood is described as \u201cfrustrated and ashamed,\u201d without persistent depressed mood most days; she denies anhedonia. No history of manic or hypomanic episodes. Sleep is irregular due to procrastination and \u201cgetting stuck scrolling\u201d at night; she averages 5\u20136 hours on weekdays and feels unrefreshed. Caffeine intake is 3\u20134 coffees/day.\n\nSubstances and medical history: Drinks alcohol socially 1\u20132 times/week, denies binge pattern. Denies cannabis or illicit substances. No significant medical conditions reported. No history of seizures or significant head injury. Family history includes a father described as \u201calways on the go\u201d with chronic disorganization and a younger brother with academic accommodations for attention problems.\n\nMental status exam (abridged): Well-groomed, cooperative, mildly restless with frequent shifting in chair and tapping foot. Speech fluent, normal volume, occasionally rapid when excited; tends to answer before the question is fully completed. Mood \u201cstressed\u201d; affect congruent, reactive. Thought process generally linear but tangential at times, requiring redirection. No psychosis. Cognition grossly intact; attention fluctuates during interview with occasional loss of train of thought. Insight good; judgment fair.\n\nRisk: Denies suicidal or homicidal ideation. No self-harm history.\n\nClinical formulation: Longstanding, developmentally early-onset pattern of inattention and restlessness with clear impairment across academic, occupational, and home settings. Social difficulties appear situational and linked to inattentive listening, impulsive interruptions, and performance anxiety rather than persistent deficits in social reciprocity or restricted/repetitive behaviors. Symptoms are not better accounted for by a primary mood disorder, psychotic disorder, substance use, or a pervasive developmental condition.",

She reports nightmares 2\u20133 nights per week in which she is back at the crash scene; she awakens \"soaked in sweat\" with pounding heart and difficulty returning to sleep.\n\nShe describes intermittent episodes at work where she feels as if she is \"watching myself from outside my body\" and briefly loses awareness of her surroundings; during these moments she has a strong sense that \"it's happening again\" and she becomes disoriented for a few minutes before regaining focus. She endorses marked psychological distress and physical reactivity (tachycardia, chest tightness, tremulousness) when passing the roadway where the crash occurred or when hearing dispatch tones for pediatric calls.\n\nShe has made efforts to avoid reminders: she has requested reassignment away from pediatric calls, avoids driving near the crash location, stopped watching news stories about accidents, and refuses to talk about the incident with colleagues. \"If anyone brings it up, I shut down or I walk out.\" She reports persistent negative emotional state characterized by guilt, shame, and anger: \"I know logically we did everything, but I keep thinking I missed something.\" She endorses a persistent negative belief about herself\u2014\"I'm not cut out for this anymore\"\u2014and has become more socially withdrawn, avoiding friends and family gatherings. She reports diminished interest in previously enjoyed activities (running, weekend outings) and describes feeling emotionally numb: \"My kids will be laughing and I feel like I'm behind glass.\" She notes difficulty experiencing positive emotions and increased detachment from her spouse, leading to conflict.\n\nArousal symptoms include irritability and verbal outbursts over minor stressors, increased hypervigilance (\"I scan every intersection\"), exaggerated startle to sudden noises, impaired concentration at work documentation, and significant sleep disturbance with prolonged sleep latency and frequent awakenings. She reports occasional panic-like episodes when trapped in traffic near the crash route, with shortness of breath and fear of losing control; she avoids these situations when possible.\n\nSymptoms have been present continuously for 8 months and have caused clinically significant impairment: she has used more sick days, received a written warning for incomplete charts, and has stopped volunteering for overtime. She denies current suicidal intent or plan but endorses fleeting passive thoughts such as \"it wouldn't matter if I didn't wake up\" during particularly bad nights; she identifies her children as a strong protective factor and agrees to seek help if thoughts worsen. She denies homicidal ideation.\n\nRegarding substances, she reports increased alcohol use since the incident, drinking 2\u20133 glasses of wine on most nights \"to shut my brain off,\" compared with 1\u20132 drinks on weekends previously. She denies morning drinking, withdrawal symptoms, or occupational intoxication, and has not used illicit substances. She drinks 2\u20133 cups of coffee daily. She denies a history of manic or hypomanic episodes, psychotic symptoms, or obsessive-compulsive rituals. She reports no prior trauma-related treatment and notes that her symptoms were not present before the crash. On mental status exam she is alert and oriented, with anxious, constricted affect; she becomes visibly tense and tearful when discussing the incident, frequently scanning the hallway noises outside the office. Thought process is linear; no delusions or hallucinations are elicited. Insight is fair; judgment is intact.",

Medical history notable for migraines and irritable bowel symptoms. Family history: father described as socially distant and rigid; maternal aunt with anxiety.",
    "clinical_text": "Ms. R is a 29-year-old software quality analyst referred by her primary care clinician for long-standing interpersonal difficulties and escalating work-related distress. She reports that over the past year she has experienced increasing fatigue, irritability, and episodic anxiety, particularly after team meetings and open-office days. She describes a pattern of \"crashing\" after social demands: \"If I have to talk a lot at work, I get home and I just lie in the dark. I can\u2019t process anything.\" She denies periods of elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, or psychotic symptoms. No history of self-harm. Passive thoughts of \"wanting to disappear\" occurred during a recent period of overwhelm but without plan or intent.\n\nShe describes persistent challenges with social communication across settings. At work she is technically strong and detail-oriented, but feedback has focused on her \"tone\" and perceived bluntness in emails and standups. She reports difficulty knowing how much to say, when to interject, and how to interpret indirect requests: \"If someone says, \u2018It\u2019d be nice if this got done soon,\u2019 I don\u2019t know if that means today, tomorrow, or they\u2019re just venting.\" She often rehearses conversations in advance and uses learned scripts to navigate small talk: \"I keep a list in my head\u2014ask about weekend, comment about weather, laugh at the right time.\" She describes masking as effortful and inconsistent: \"People think I\u2019m outgoing at first, then later they say I\u2019m cold. I\u2019m not trying to be cold\u2014I\u2019m just out of words.\" She reports that she frequently misses sarcasm unless it is exaggerated, and she struggles with reading facial expressions when there is background noise or multiple people speaking. She notes that she can maintain eye contact but experiences it as uncomfortable and tends to look at the bridge of the nose or alternate looking away to concentrate.\n\nHer social relationships are limited. She has one close friend from college whom she sees every few months and communicates with mainly by text. She reports difficulty sustaining friendships due to uncertainty about expectations: \"I don\u2019t know how often you\u2019re supposed to check in. If I don\u2019t have new information, I don\u2019t message.\" She tends to take statements literally and has had repeated misunderstandings in dating contexts; she ended her last relationship after feeling overwhelmed by spontaneous plans and frequent emotional discussions, stating, \"I didn\u2019t know what was required of me.\" She prefers structured interactions centered around shared activities (board games, coding projects) rather than unstructured conversation. She describes empathy as present but sometimes delayed: \"I care, but in the moment I\u2019m trying to figure out what face to make. Later I\u2019ll replay it and feel awful that I didn\u2019t react right.\"\n\nShe reports long-standing restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. Since childhood she has had highly focused interests that become consuming for months to years. Currently she spends several hours nightly cataloging transit routes and service changes; she keeps spreadsheets and maps and can recite historical schedule revisions. She describes these activities as soothing and states, \"If I\u2019m stressed, I need to sort the data. It quiets my brain.\" She also reports repetitive motor behaviors, particularly when anxious: rubbing the pads of her fingers together, rocking subtly in her chair, and tapping a precise rhythm on her leg. She describes feeling compelled to finish certain routines \"the right way\" and becomes distressed if interrupted.\n\nMarked preference for sameness is evident. She eats a narrow range of foods prepared in specific ways and becomes nauseated when textures are unexpected. She follows consistent morning and evening routines and becomes dysregulated when plans change suddenly: \"If my calendar shifts last-minute, I feel like my skin is buzzing. I can\u2019t think.\" She reports several episodes of what she calls \"shutdowns\" after unexpected changes or sensory overload\u2014becoming quiet, unable to speak easily, and needing to retreat to a dark, silent space for 30\u201390 minutes.\n\nShe describes significant sensory sensitivities: fluorescent lighting triggers headaches, certain fabrics \"feel like sandpaper,\" and mixed environmental noise (multiple conversations, clinking dishes) is \"physically painful.\" She wears noise-reducing earbuds in public and avoids grocery stores during peak hours. She reports heightened sensitivity to smells, particularly perfumes, which can precipitate nausea and migraines. She also seeks certain sensory input, such as deep pressure from weighted blankets and tight hoodies.\n\nDevelopmental history, obtained from Ms. R and corroborated by a phone interview with her mother, indicates these patterns have been present since early childhood. Her mother recalls that Ms. R spoke early and used advanced vocabulary but had an unusual prosody described as \"a little sing-song\" and tended to monologue about preferred topics. She preferred solitary play, lining up toy animals by size and color and becoming upset if siblings rearranged them. She had difficulty with pretend play involving social roles unless it followed a familiar script from books or TV. She was described as academically strong but socially awkward; teachers noted that she was \"very literal\" and struggled with group work. She had intense distress with certain clothing seams and resisted hair brushing. She had few friends and was often \"on the edge of the group\" during recess.\n\nCurrently, she reports prominent anxiety symptoms that appear situational and linked to performance and uncertainty. Prior to meetings she experiences tachycardia, stomach discomfort, and anticipatory worry about making social errors. She denies intrusive thoughts or compulsions aimed at preventing feared outcomes beyond her routine preferences; she experiences her routines as stabilizing rather than driven by fear of harm. She also endorses longstanding inattentive symptoms (misplacing items, difficulty shifting between tasks, becoming absorbed in details) but states that when tasks align with her interests she can sustain attention for hours. Sleep is variable; she often stays up late engaged in her interests and then struggles to transition to bed.\n\nMental status exam: Well-groomed, cooperative, mildly tense posture. Speech fluent with occasional formal phrasing; volume and rate generally normal; prosody mildly atypical at times. Mood \"tired and on edge\"; affect somewhat constricted but appropriate. Thought process linear and detail-focused. No delusions or hallucinations. Cognition grossly intact; insight fair. She demonstrates difficulty with reciprocal conversational flow, tending to provide long, information-dense answers and needing prompts to check the interviewer\u2019s perspective.\n\nOverall, her presentation reflects a lifelong pattern of social-communication differences and restricted/repetitive behaviors with sensory sensitivities, causing clinically significant impairment in occupational functioning and stress tolerance, with secondary anxiety symptoms in response to social and environmental demands.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. R is a 38-year-old night-shift nurse who presents to an outpatient clinic at the urging of her sister due to a 7-week history of worsening mood and functional decline. She reports feeling \"down almost all day, every day\" and describes a marked reduction in interest in previously enjoyed activities (she stopped running and has not attended her book club for over a month). She states, \"Even when I have time off, I just sit there. Nothing feels worth it.\"\n\nShe endorses sleep disturbance with both difficulty falling asleep after shifts and early-morning awakening on days off, averaging 3\u20135 hours per night. She describes low energy and feeling \"heavy\" throughout the day, with a noticeable decline in work performance, including charting errors and slower task completion. She reports impaired concentration: \"I read the same sentence five times and it doesn\u2019t stick.\" Appetite has decreased with an unintentional 8-pound weight loss over approximately 6 weeks. She also notes increased irritability, particularly with her son, followed by guilt: \"I snap and then I hate myself for it.\" She expresses excessive self-criticism and feelings of worthlessness related to her separation and perceived parenting failures.\n\nShe reports intermittent psychomotor slowing observed by family (\"You move like you\u2019re wading through mud\" per her sister). She denies panic attacks but describes persistent worry and tension about finances and custody that feel difficult to control, along with restlessness and muscle tightness; however, she identifies the low mood and loss of interest as the most impairing symptoms. She has also had frequent tension headaches and GI upset; she initially attributed these to shift work but is now concerned they are \"my body giving up.\"\n\nRegarding safety, she endorses passive thoughts of death occurring several times per week: \"I\u2019ve caught myself thinking it would be easier if I didn\u2019t wake up.\" She denies any current plan or intent, denies preparatory behaviors, and states she would not act because of her son. There is no history of suicide attempts or self-injury. She denies homicidal ideation.\n\nShe denies periods of abnormally elevated or expansive mood, inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, pressured speech, racing thoughts, or risky behaviors. She denies hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia. She reports drinking 1\u20132 glasses of wine on 4\u20135 nights per week over the past month \"to shut my brain off,\" with no morning drinking, no withdrawal symptoms, and no prior history of alcohol-related consequences. She denies illicit substance use.\n\nStressors include a recent separation (3 months ago) and increased workload due to staffing shortages. She reports limited social support outside family and has been calling out sick more frequently. Past psychiatric history includes brief counseling during college after a breakup; no prior antidepressant trials. Family history is notable for a mother with recurrent episodes of depression treated with medication.\n\nOn mental status examination, she is appropriately groomed but appears tired. Eye contact is intermittent. Speech is soft with normal rate. Mood is \"exhausted and numb\" with constricted affect. Thought process is linear. Thought content is notable for self-critical ruminations; no psychotic content. Cognition is grossly intact though attention is reduced on serial sevens. Insight and judgment are fair. She agrees to a safety plan, including removing excess medications from home, identifying warning signs, and contacting crisis services or presenting to the emergency department if suicidal thoughts intensify.\n\nRecent basic labs obtained by her primary care clinician (including TSH) are reported as within her usual therapeutic range. She denies recent medication changes. Symptoms cause clinically significant distress and impair occupational and parenting functioning, persisting most days for more than a month and not better explained by bereavement or another medical condition based on current information.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. A is a 34-year-old project manager who presents for evaluation due to persistent, difficult-to-control worry that has been present most days for approximately 10 months and has intensified over the last 3\u20134 months. She describes her mind as \"always scanning for what could go wrong\" and reports worries spanning multiple areas: work performance and layoffs, her child\u2019s safety and health, finances, and her own health. She notes she often reassures herself briefly but the worry returns within minutes: \"Even when things are okay, my brain tells me it\u2019s temporary.\" She reports spending hours each day thinking through contingencies, repeatedly checking emails and calendars, and seeking reassurance from her spouse (e.g., repeatedly asking if bills were paid, if the child\u2019s fever means something serious).\n\nShe reports difficulty controlling the worry, stating, \"I tell myself to stop, but it just keeps running in the background.\" She endorses associated symptoms including restlessness and feeling keyed up (\"I can\u2019t relax on the couch; I\u2019m always shifting or getting up to do something\"), easy fatigability (particularly by late afternoon), difficulty concentrating (\"I reread the same paragraph five times\"), irritability (snapping at her spouse and coworkers), muscle tension (chronic neck and shoulder tightness with jaw clenching), and sleep disturbance (takes 60\u201390 minutes to fall asleep due to rumination; wakes at 3\u20134 a.m. thinking about tasks). She reports that on weekends she intends to rest but ends up catching up on work or household tasks because being idle makes her feel more anxious.\n\nFunctionally, she is still working but describes a decline in efficiency and increased errors due to distractibility and overchecking. She avoids delegating tasks at work because \"if I\u2019m not in control, something will slip.\" At home, she finds herself overpreparing for routine events (packing extra supplies for short outings, repeatedly confirming doors are locked). She reports increased conflict with her spouse over her need for reassurance and her irritability. She denies current or past episodes of persistently elevated mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, grandiosity, or risky behavior.\n\nNon-standard features include prominent somatic and health-focused worry. She reports intermittent gastrointestinal upset (bloating, loose stools) that worsens during high-stress periods and has previously been labeled as stress-related by her primary care clinician; she fears it could represent a serious illness despite normal prior basic labs. She also reports tension headaches several times per week. She describes occasional brief surges of anxiety with palpitations and shortness of breath when receiving unexpected work messages, but these episodes are situational, short-lived, and do not occur unexpectedly or lead to persistent avoidance of specific places; her primary distress is the ongoing, generalized worry rather than discrete attacks.\n\nMood symptoms are present but subthreshold and appear secondary to chronic anxiety: she reports feeling \"drained\" and less interested in hobbies due to fatigue and time spent worrying, but denies pervasive anhedonia, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation. Appetite is variable; she sometimes eats less when anxious. She denies psychotic symptoms. She denies obsessions with ritualized compulsions; her checking behaviors are described as attempts to reduce worry and prevent perceived negative outcomes rather than driven by intrusive, unwanted images with strict repetitive rituals.\n\nSubstance use: she drinks 1\u20132 glasses of wine on 3 nights per week and notes it sometimes helps her \"shut off\" at night but worsens sleep quality; she denies morning drinking, blackouts, or withdrawal symptoms. She drinks 2\u20133 coffees daily and notices jitteriness if she exceeds that. She denies cannabis or other illicit substances. She is not taking stimulants or thyroid medication. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable; she reports no history of hyperthyroidism, arrhythmia, or respiratory disease. Family history is notable for a mother described as a \"constant worrier\" and a brother with episodic depression.\n\nOn mental status examination, she is neatly groomed, cooperative, and mildly fidgety. Speech is normal rate and tone. Mood is \"anxious,\" affect congruent and reactive. Thought process is linear but ruminative; thought content notable for excessive worry and catastrophizing. No delusions, hallucinations, or suicidal/homicidal ideation. Insight is fair; judgment is intact. She expresses motivation for treatment, stating, \"I don\u2019t want to live like I\u2019m bracing for impact all the time.\"",

    "clinical_text": "The patient presents for evaluation due to long-standing difficulties with attention and organization that have become more impairing after a recent promotion requiring more self-directed work. She reports, \u201cMy brain feels like a browser with 30 tabs open, and I can\u2019t find the one I need.\u201d She describes frequent careless errors in routine tasks (e.g., sending emails with missing attachments, misreading meeting times), and needing repeated reminders to complete multi-step assignments. She states she often starts work promptly but \u201cdrifts off\u201d within minutes, especially during reading-heavy tasks or long meetings, and later realizes she missed key details.\n\nShe endorses a pattern of not following through on tasks despite good intentions: \u201cI\u2019ll make a list, start item one, then suddenly I\u2019m reorganizing a folder, and the original task never gets finished.\u201d She describes chronic disorganization\u2014difficulty prioritizing, underestimating how long tasks take, and struggling to keep her workspace and digital files orderly. She procrastinates on tasks requiring sustained mental effort (expense reports, reviewing contracts), often waiting until deadlines create pressure. She frequently misplaces essentials such as her badge, phone, keys, and paperwork, and relies heavily on her partner and smartphone trackers. She reports being easily distracted by background conversations, notifications, and her own thoughts; she will \u201ctune in\u201d to an unrelated idea and then lose track of the conversation. She also describes forgetfulness in daily routines (missing appointments unless multiple reminders are set, forgetting to return calls, forgetting items at the store even with a list).\n\nShe notes some restlessness that is more noticeable at work: fidgeting, tapping her foot, and feeling compelled to get up during prolonged meetings. She denies significant interrupting but admits she sometimes blurts out a thought in team discussions because \u201cif I don\u2019t say it right then, it disappears.\u201d She is not described as consistently \"on the go\" and does not report excessive talking.\n\nDevelopmental history is notable for similar symptoms starting in elementary school. She recalls teachers commenting that she was \u201cbright but daydreamy,\u201d frequently forgetting homework, losing school materials, and needing parents to sit with her to complete assignments. She reports she could focus intensely on highly interesting activities (drawing, certain video games) but struggled with boring or repetitive work. These issues were present both at school and at home. She denies conduct problems. She completed college with strong grades but reports it required \u201call-nighters, last-minute adrenaline, and constant extensions,\u201d and she frequently pulled away from social activities because she was overwhelmed by unfinished tasks.\n\nCurrent impairment is evident across settings. At work, she has received feedback about missed details and inconsistent follow-through, despite overall strong ideas and interpersonal skills. At home, bills are sometimes paid late, chores are started and left unfinished, and her partner reports frustration with \u201chalf-done projects\u201d and frequent lost items. She describes increased worry about performance and fear of letting others down, saying, \u201cI\u2019m always anxious I forgot something important.\u201d She experiences intermittent muscle tension and difficulty winding down at night, often scrolling on her phone or jumping between tasks. Sleep averages 5\u20136 hours on weekdays, with a delayed bedtime when she is trying to catch up on unfinished work; she feels fatigued and more distractible the next day.\n\nShe denies episodes of elevated mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, grandiosity, or other symptoms suggesting a manic/hypomanic episode. She denies persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, or suicidal ideation; she reports stress-related low mood at times but says it lifts when deadlines pass. She denies hallucinations or delusional beliefs. She denies heavy alcohol use and denies illicit substance use. Caffeine intake is 2\u20133 coffees/day, sometimes more when trying to focus. Medical history is unremarkable; no history of seizures or significant head injury. Family history includes a father described as \u201cdisorganized and always late,\u201d and a sibling with a history of academic difficulties.\n\nOn mental status examination, she is cooperative and well-groomed. Speech is normal rate and volume. Mood is \u201cstressed,\u201d affect congruent. Thought process is generally linear though occasionally tangential when describing multiple examples; she self-corrects with prompting. Attention during the interview fluctuates; she asks for questions to be repeated once and checks notes on her phone. Insight and judgment are intact. Overall presentation suggests a chronic, cross-situational pattern of inattention with some restlessness, with secondary performance anxiety and sleep disruption contributing to severity but not fully accounting for the longstanding symptoms.",

Grew up in a stable home, met developmental milestones, and reports typical childhood friendships and activities. Previously described himself as sociable and comfortable presenting at work.",
    "clinical_text": "He presents for evaluation 8 months after a workplace incident in which an industrial explosion occurred at a nearby warehouse he was visiting for a systems rollout. He reports being within ~30 meters when the blast happened, seeing debris strike coworkers, and witnessing a colleague die despite attempted first aid. He describes intense fear and helplessness at the time: \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018This is it, I\u2019m going to die,\u2019 and then it was just screaming and smoke.\u201d\n\nSince the event, he reports recurrent, involuntary distressing memories that intrude \u201cout of nowhere,\u201d often triggered by metallic smells, diesel fumes, or hearing backup beepers. He describes episodes of feeling as if he is back at the scene: \u201cFor a few seconds my brain is there again\u2014my hands shake, I can smell the smoke, and I\u2019m not in my apartment anymore.\u201d His partner has observed him waking in panic several times per week, drenched in sweat, after nightmares with themes of being trapped or unable to help someone. He becomes visibly tense during the interview when a hallway door slams; he startles, scans the room, and apologizes, saying, \u201cLoud bangs make my body react before I can think.\u201d\n\nHe reports persistent avoidance. He refuses to visit any warehouse sites, has rerouted his commute to avoid passing the facility, and will not watch news clips or read articles about industrial accidents. He avoids conversations about the incident at work and becomes irritable when coworkers \u201cbring it up like it\u2019s just a story.\u201d He also avoids certain music that was playing in the vehicle just before arriving at the site.\n\nHe endorses a marked shift in beliefs and mood since the event. He reports persistent negative beliefs about safety and control (\u201cThe world is random and dangerous; if something can go wrong it will\u201d), and self-blame despite reassurance from others (\u201cIf I had pushed for a different layout, he might still be alive\u201d). He describes diminished interest in previously enjoyed activities, including weekend soccer and social outings: \u201cIt all feels pointless.\u201d He reports emotional numbing and difficulty experiencing positive emotions: \u201cEven when something good happens, it doesn\u2019t land.\u201d He feels detached from others, including his partner: \u201cI\u2019m there physically, but I\u2019m not really with people.\u201d\n\nHe reports irritability and anger outbursts that are uncharacteristic for him: snapping at his partner and coworkers, then feeling guilty. He notes difficulty concentrating, especially when coding: \u201cMy mind keeps drifting back to that day.\u201d Sleep is fragmented due to nightmares and difficulty falling asleep; he checks locks repeatedly and keeps the lights on in the hallway. He describes hypervigilance in public spaces, choosing seats facing exits, scanning for hazards, and feeling \u201con edge\u201d in crowds.\n\nThe presentation is diagnostically challenging because he has begun to appear socially awkward in recent months: he speaks more formally and sometimes uses a monotone voice during stressful moments, avoids eye contact when discussing the event, and has become very rigid about routines at home. He has instituted strict evening rules (specific shower sequence, checking the stove and doors in a fixed order, placing shoes in an exact position) and becomes distressed if the routine is interrupted. He also reports heightened sensory sensitivity, particularly to sudden sounds and strong smells, and he wears noise-canceling headphones in supermarkets. When asked, he states these patterns started after the explosion: \u201cI didn\u2019t used to be like this. I was never the \u2018routine\u2019 guy. Now it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t do it the same way, something bad will happen.\u201d His partner corroborates that before the incident he enjoyed spontaneous plans, hosted friends, and could tolerate busy environments.\n\nCollateral developmental history does not suggest lifelong social-communication differences. He reports having friends throughout childhood, participating in team sports, dating in high school and college, and previously performing well in a leadership role that required frequent interpersonal interaction and public speaking. No history is reported of early language delay, persistent difficulty understanding social reciprocity, or restricted interests from childhood. The current social withdrawal and reduced reciprocity appear temporally linked to the traumatic event and are largely driven by fear, detachment, and avoidance rather than longstanding interpersonal misunderstanding.\n\nHe denies current or past mania/hypomania. He reports occasional passive thoughts such as \u201cI wish I could just not wake up,\u201d particularly after nightmares, but denies active suicidal intent, plan, or preparatory behaviors; protective factors include his partner and work goals. He denies hallucinations or fixed delusions outside of brief stress-related episodes described above. He drinks alcohol 1\u20132 drinks on weekends and denies increased use since the incident; he denies illicit substances. Medical history is unremarkable. He reports significant functional impairment: reduced productivity, missed days due to sleep loss, avoidance of key job duties requiring site visits, and strain in his relationship due to emotional distance and irritability.",

Referred by primary care after recurrent work-related burnout and social difficulties. No history of substance use. Family history notable for a father described as \"very quiet, rigid about routines\" and a maternal aunt with anxiety.",
    "clinical_text": "Chief concerns: \"I keep burning out at work and I never know what people actually mean,\" and \"social stuff feels like a script I have to run.\"\n\nHistory of presenting concerns:\nThe patient presents for evaluation due to longstanding difficulties with social interaction and increasing distress in the workplace over the past year. She reports she performs well on tasks with clear rules and measurable outcomes, but struggles in meetings and informal interactions. She states, \"If someone says, 'Can you take a look at this when you get a chance?' I don't know if they mean now, today, or next week. Then I overthink it and freeze.\" She describes frequent misunderstandings of indirect requests, sarcasm, and workplace politics, noting, \"People tell me I'm blunt. I think I'm being accurate.\" She endorses significant anxiety before team meetings and often rehearses potential conversations, later ruminating about whether she \"said something wrong.\"\n\nSocial communication and interaction:\nShe describes limited social reciprocity and difficulty sustaining back-and-forth conversation unless discussing topics of strong interest. \"I can talk forever about commuter rail systems or bird classifications, but if it's just small talk, my mind goes blank.\" She reports that in social settings she often asks factual questions but has trouble knowing when to share personal information or how to respond to emotional disclosures. She recounts a recent example: a coworker mentioned a breakup, and she responded by offering a list of practical steps (housing, finances, scheduling). The coworker reportedly became upset, and the patient states, \"I didn't understand what I did wrong\u2014I thought I was helping.\"\n\nShe reports difficulty developing and maintaining friendships. She has one close friend from college with similar interests and prefers online communities focused on her hobbies. She states, \"I want friends, but it feels exhausting. After an hour I need to be alone.\" She describes uncertainty about social rules and relies on learned scripts: \"I watch how other people do it and copy. I can mask for a while, but then I crash.\" She endorses longstanding difficulty interpreting subtle facial expressions and tone, adding, \"I miss the hints. People expect you to just know.\" On examination, she is cooperative and articulate; eye contact is intermittent and tends to be brief, especially when discussing emotions. Her facial expressiveness is somewhat limited, and her prosody is occasionally formal.\n\nRestricted/repetitive behaviors, routines, and interests:\nShe describes a long history of repetitive behaviors, particularly when anxious or overstimulated: she rubs the pads of her fingers together, rocks subtly when seated, and paces in a fixed route at home. She notes, \"I didn't realize other people don't do this. It calms my body down.\" She reports strong preference for predictability and distress with changes in routine. She eats a narrow range of foods on weekdays, wears a \"uniform\" of similar clothing to avoid decision fatigue, and becomes markedly distressed when plans change at short notice: \"If my schedule shifts, it feels like my brain can't re-map and I get irritable or shut down.\" She reports at least two episodes in the past six months where unexpected changes (meeting moved earlier, last-minute request) led to crying, shaking, and leaving work abruptly to calm down in her car.\n\nShe has intense, circumscribed interests that have been present for years, including transit maps, timetables, and bird taxonomy. She describes spending hours creating spreadsheets of routes and tracking sightings, stating, \"It\u2019s relaxing because the system makes sense.\" She acknowledges these interests can dominate her time and conversation and have contributed to social strain.\n\nSensory processing:\nShe reports heightened sensitivity to sound and certain textures. Open-plan office noise is described as \"physically painful,\" especially sudden laughter, keyboard clatter, and multiple conversations. She wears noise-cancelling headphones when permitted and avoids fluorescent-lit stores. She reports aversion to certain fabric seams and tags and becomes distressed by strong odors. She describes occasional sensory overload: \"It feels like everything is too loud and too bright and my thoughts jam.\"\n\nDevelopmental history:\nThe patient reports these patterns began in early childhood. Her mother (contacted with consent) recalls that as a child she preferred solitary play, lined up toys, and became upset if others altered her arrangements. She spoke early with an advanced vocabulary but was described as \"little professor-ish\" and struggled with peer relationships. She was often called \"bossy\" or \"odd\" in elementary school and had episodes of tearfulness after school. She excelled academically, particularly in science and memorization. She had no history of language delay requiring intervention, and there is no reported history of intellectual disability.\n\nFunctional impact:\nShe is currently employed but reports increasing difficulty managing the social demands of work, leading to absenteeism and reduced productivity following \"crashes\" after heavy meeting days. She avoids workplace social events, which has affected team integration. She reports significant effort to compensate: scripting, extensive note-taking, and strict routines. At home, she can manage activities of daily living but spends much of her non-work time recovering in low-stimulation environments.\n\nComorbid features (non-primary):\nShe endorses generalized worry, muscle tension, and sleep-onset insomnia that worsen around social stressors and unexpected changes. She reports occasional panic-like episodes in overstimulating environments (racing heart, shortness of breath, urge to escape) that resolve when she leaves the situation and reduces sensory input. She also reports chronic inattention to mundane tasks and misplacing items but denies a lifelong pattern of hyperactivity; these symptoms may be exacerbated by anxiety and workplace overload.\n\nRisk and other psychiatric review:\nShe denies current or past suicidal ideation, self-harm, or homicidal ideation. No history of manic episodes or psychosis. Mood is described as \"stressed and tired,\" with frustration related to misunderstanding at work; no pervasive anhedonia. She denies substance misuse.\n\nMental status examination (abbrev.):\nWell-groomed, dressed in comfortable repetitive style. Behavior calm; occasional finger rubbing noted during discussion of work stress. Speech fluent with formal phrasing; tends toward detailed, fact-based responses. Affect mildly constricted but appropriate. Thought process linear and detail-oriented. Insight fair; judgment intact. Cognition grossly intact.\n\nClinical impression:\nThe presentation is characterized by persistent social-communication differences across contexts, difficulties with reciprocal interaction and interpreting implicit social cues, limited ability to sustain typical peer relationships, longstanding restricted interests and need for routine, repetitive self-soothing behaviors, and pronounced sensory sensitivities, with onset in early development and clinically significant impairment in occupational functioning. Anxiety appears present as a secondary response to chronic social/sensory stress and uncertainty.",

    "clinical_text": "32-year-old high-school English teacher presents for evaluation due to persistent anxiety and worsening mood. She reports that for the past 8\u20139 months she has been \"on edge basically every day\" with excessive worry occurring more days than not. Worries span multiple domains, including job performance (\"I\u2019m convinced I\u2019m going to mess up a lesson and get fired\"), finances (\"even though we can pay bills, I keep imagining something catastrophic\"), health concerns (\"every headache makes me think something is seriously wrong\"), and her spouse\u2019s safety (\"if they\u2019re late home I assume there\u2019s been an accident\"). She describes the worry as difficult to control, stating, \"I tell myself to stop, but my brain keeps running scenarios.\" She notes associated symptoms over this same time period: feeling keyed up/restless (frequently fidgeting and pacing in the evenings), easy fatigability (\"I\u2019m exhausted by midday\"), difficulty concentrating (\"I read student essays and realize I didn\u2019t absorb anything\"), irritability (\"I snap over small things and then feel awful\"), muscle tension (tight shoulders/jaw with frequent tension headaches), and sleep disturbance (takes 60\u201390 minutes to fall asleep with frequent awakenings, waking unrefreshed). She reports the anxiety has led to functional impairment: she stays late at work repeatedly rechecking lesson plans and emails, avoids taking on new tasks, and has withdrawn from social plans because she feels overwhelmed.\n\nOver the last 7\u20138 weeks, she reports a clear downturn in mood beyond her baseline anxiety. She describes a persistent depressed mood most of the day nearly every day, stating, \"I feel heavy and hopeless when I wake up, like nothing will get better.\" She also reports markedly diminished interest or pleasure: \"I used to love reading and cooking\u2014now I don\u2019t care.\" She notes decreased appetite with unintentional weight loss of about 8 pounds over the past month, along with worsening insomnia (early-morning awakening around 4 a.m. with inability to return to sleep). She endorses low energy and psychomotor slowing observed by others: \"My husband says I move like I\u2019m underwater.\" She reports reduced concentration and indecisiveness (\"Even picking what to grade first feels impossible\") and feelings of worthlessness/excessive guilt (\"I feel like a bad teacher and a bad partner; I\u2019m letting everyone down\"). She endorses recurrent thoughts of death over the past two weeks\u2014\"Sometimes I think it would be easier not to wake up\"\u2014but denies a plan or intent, denies past attempts, and agrees to seek help and contact supports if these thoughts intensify.\n\nShe denies any history of periods with abnormally elevated or expansive mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, pressured speech, inflated self-esteem, or risky behaviors. She denies panic attacks that occur unexpectedly, hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized behavior. No recent bereavement. She denies recent medication changes, stimulant use, or excessive caffeine beyond one morning coffee. Medical review is notable only for tension headaches; she denies symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism. There is no evidence that symptoms are attributable to substances or a medical condition based on history. Overall presentation reflects sustained, hard-to-control worry across multiple areas for months with prominent somatic/cognitive anxiety symptoms and impairment, alongside a concurrent 7\u20138 week episode of depressed mood and loss of interest with neurovegetative changes, guilt/worthlessness, impaired concentration, and passive suicidal ideation causing significant distress and functional decline.",

She reports that for at least the past year she has been \u201con edge almost every day,\u201d worrying about multiple areas: job performance and being fired, finances, her parents\u2019 health, and making mistakes that \u201cwill ruin everything.\u201d She describes the worry as excessive compared with peers: \u201cEveryone\u2019s stressed, but I spiral for hours.\u201d She finds it difficult to control and notes that even when one concern is resolved, \u201cmy brain immediately finds a new thing to worry about.\u201d She endorses associated symptoms occurring on most days: restlessness (\u201cI feel keyed up like I can\u2019t relax\u201d), easy fatigue (\u201cI\u2019m exhausted by midafternoon even if I didn\u2019t do much\u201d), trouble concentrating (\u201cI read the same email five times and still miss details\u201d), irritability (\u201csmall stuff sets me off and then I feel guilty\u201d), muscle tension (tight shoulders/jaw with frequent headaches), and sleep disturbance (takes 60\u201390 minutes to fall asleep due to rumination; wakes unrefreshed). She reports functional impact: decreased productivity, avoidance of tasks perceived as high-stakes, and strained relationships due to irritability.\n\nIn parallel, she describes longstanding patterns of inattentive and impulsive behavior that predate her anxiety. She recalls difficulties beginning in elementary school: \u201cTeachers said I daydreamed, forgot homework, and my desk was a disaster.\u201d She reports that by age 10 she frequently lost school materials, left assignments unfinished, and needed repeated reminders. In middle and high school she did \u201cwell on tests but turned things in late,\u201d often completing work the night before and misjudging time. She denies that these early difficulties were due to mood episodes, substance use, or unstable housing.\n\nCurrent symptoms include frequent careless mistakes at work (e.g., sending drafts with missing attachments, overlooking line items), difficulty sustaining attention in meetings (\u201cI try, but five minutes in I\u2019m mentally somewhere else\u201d), and trouble completing tasks despite intent (\u201cI start a project, then I\u2019m pulled to something else and the first thing just sits\u201d). She describes poor organization and weak time management: multiple unfinished to-do lists, missed deadlines, and chronic lateness. She avoids or procrastinates on tasks requiring sustained mental effort, especially detailed reporting: \u201cI\u2019ll do anything else\u2014clean my apartment, reorganize files\u2014before I write the report.\u201d She frequently misplaces items (badge, keys, phone) and is easily distracted by external stimuli and internal thoughts (\u201cIf someone walks by or Slack pings, I\u2019m gone\u201d). She also endorses forgetfulness in daily activities (forgetting appointments unless multiple alerts are set; leaving groceries in the car).\n\nShe notes symptoms consistent with hyperactive/impulsive tendencies in adulthood: feeling internally restless (\u201clike a motor running\u201d), difficulty sitting through long meetings, fidgeting, and talking excessively when anxious (\u201cI interrupt without meaning to\u201d). She reports blurting out answers in conversations and finishing others\u2019 sentences, and she has trouble waiting her turn in group discussions. She describes making impulsive purchases online \u201cto relieve the stress,\u201d later regretting them due to financial impact.\n\nCourse and impairment across settings: The attentional and organizational difficulties occur at work and at home (missed bill payments, clutter, forgetting chores/commitments). She reports that these patterns have contributed to repeated performance feedback at work, including being placed on a performance improvement plan 3 months ago. At home, she has conflict with her roommate about shared responsibilities (\u201cI genuinely forget, then I feel awful\u201d). The chronic worry amplifies her impairment: she double-checks emails repeatedly, spends excessive time re-reading documents, and seeks reassurance from coworkers, which further delays task completion. She describes a self-reinforcing cycle: missed details or delays lead to intense worry about consequences, which then worsens concentration and increases procrastination.\n\nRisk and safety: She denies current or past suicidal ideation, self-harm, or suicide attempts. No homicidal ideation. No history of psychosis or manic/hypomanic episodes. She denies panic attacks that come \u201cout of the blue,\u201d though she does describe sustained tension and occasional surges of anxiety related to work deadlines.\n\nSubstance/medical: She denies illicit substance use. Alcohol is limited to 0\u20132 drinks on weekends; she denies binge use. No misuse of stimulants or sedatives. She reports no thyroid disease, seizure disorder, or sleep apnea symptoms. Caffeine intake is stable and modest; she avoids energy drinks.\n\nMental status (summary): Well-groomed; cooperative; psychomotor mildly fidgety. Speech normal rate/volume but occasionally tangential when describing worries. Mood \u201cstressed\u201d; affect anxious but reactive. Thought process generally linear with occasional circumstantiality. Thought content notable for excessive worries and self-criticism; no delusions. Cognition intact; attention variable during interview (asked for a question to be repeated twice). Insight fair; judgment generally intact.\n\nPatient quotes illustrating interaction: \u201cI\u2019m constantly worried I missed something, and then I\u2019m checking so much that I can\u2019t finish.\u201d \u201cIf I try to focus, my mind wanders to all the ways I could mess up.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been like this since I was a kid\u2014always losing things\u2014but the worry has gotten bigger as responsibilities grew.\u201d",

Over the past 8\u201310 months she has experienced excessive worry occurring most days about multiple areas: work performance (\u201cI\u2019m sure I missed something and it\u2019ll blow up\u201d), finances (\u201cWhat if I get fired because I can\u2019t keep up?\u201d), her parents\u2019 health (\u201cIf I don\u2019t answer a text I assume something bad happened\u201d), and her relationship (\u201cI replay conversations and worry I said the wrong thing\u201d). She describes the worry as difficult to control: \u201cEven when I tell myself it\u2019s unlikely, my brain keeps spinning.\u201d She reports associated symptoms on most days including feeling keyed up and restless (\u201cI\u2019m on edge\u201d), easy fatigue by afternoon, irritability (\u201csmall things set me off\u201d), muscle tension in her neck/jaw with frequent clenching, and sleep disturbance characterized by prolonged sleep onset due to rumination and occasional early awakening.\n\nFunctionally, she spends significant time seeking reassurance and double-checking, which paradoxically worsens delays. She reports frequently rereading emails, rewriting to avoid mistakes, and checking her calendar repeatedly, yet still misses tasks: \u201cI check ten times and still forget the one thing that mattered.\u201d She denies discrete episodes of sudden terror with palpitations or fear of dying; her anxiety is described as persistent and spread across topics rather than brief surges. She denies intrusive unwanted images or repetitive rituals performed to reduce distress beyond the practical checking noted above. She denies current or past hallucinations or delusional beliefs.\n\nLongstanding attention/organization symptoms: She reports a persistent pattern since childhood of difficulty sustaining attention, disorganization, and forgetfulness. At work she struggles to remain focused during meetings unless she is taking extensive notes; she \u201czones out\u201d and realizes she missed key points. She frequently makes careless errors (e.g., attaching the wrong file, overlooking details in project timelines), has difficulty following through on multi-step tasks, and often starts tasks but shifts to others before finishing. She describes chronic procrastination and avoidance of tasks requiring sustained mental effort (e.g., preparing project reports), often waiting until the last minute with resulting stress and rushed work. She has difficulty organizing tasks and time, relies on multiple digital reminders that become cluttered, and still misses deadlines. She frequently misplaces items such as her badge, phone, and earbuds, and describes being easily distracted by unrelated thoughts or external stimuli (\u201cIf someone walks by or my phone buzzes, I\u2019m gone\u201d). She reports forgetting to return messages and forgetting appointments unless repeatedly reminded.\n\nHyperactive/impulsive symptoms are also present though less prominent than inattention: she frequently fidgets, taps her foot, and finds it hard to sit through long meetings. She often feels internally restless (\u201clike a motor running\u201d) and tends to talk quickly when anxious. She acknowledges interrupting others or finishing their sentences, especially when excited or worried about forgetting her point. She sometimes blurts out responses in meetings before others finish, later feeling embarrassed.\n\nDevelopmental/childhood history: She reports that these attention and restlessness symptoms were present before age 12. She recalls teachers commenting that she was \u201cbright but not working to potential,\u201d frequently forgot homework, had a messy desk/locker, and was often distracted and chatty. Her parent corroborates that she needed repeated prompts for chores and often lost school materials. She reports similar difficulties across settings (school, home, and now work).\n\nCourse and impairment: She reports impairment in occupational functioning (missed deadlines, performance feedback about disorganization and not following through), interpersonal stress (partner frustrated by forgetfulness and unfinished household tasks), and increased distress due to worry about consequences. She describes a self-reinforcing cycle: missed details and procrastination increase worry and muscle tension; the worry then further disrupts concentration and sleep, worsening daytime attention and productivity.\n\nMood and safety: She reports feeling \u201cstressed and overwhelmed,\u201d but denies persistent depressed mood most of the day nearly every day for weeks, denies anhedonia, and denies current suicidal ideation or self-harm. She denies lifetime episodes of abnormally elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, or risky behavior. Energy is variable and often reduced due to poor sleep and tension rather than episodic mood changes.\n\nSubstances/medical: She denies stimulant, cannabis, or other illicit drug use. She reports that symptoms occur regardless of caffeine intake, though excessive coffee increases jitteriness. No history suggestive of hyperthyroidism or other medical explanation is reported. No current medications.\n\nMental status exam (abbreviated): Well-groomed, cooperative. Motor: mild psychomotor restlessness with frequent fidgeting. Speech: normal volume, mildly rapid at times. Mood \u201canxious\u201d; affect congruent, full range. Thought process linear but occasionally tangential when describing multiple tasks. Thought content notable for pervasive worries about multiple life domains; no psychosis. Cognition: alert and oriented; attention intermittently impaired during interview (asked for repetition of a question once; self-corrected). Insight and judgment fair.\n\nSummary impression: The presentation is characterized by longstanding, cross-situational inattention with some hyperactive/impulsive features beginning in childhood and causing functional impairment, alongside persistent, difficult-to-control, excessive worry across multiple domains for more than 6 months with associated restlessness, fatigue, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance, contributing to significant distress and compounding attentional difficulties.",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \"I can\u2019t stop reliving it, and I feel like I\u2019m failing at everything.\"\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient presents for evaluation of persistent distress and declining functioning that began after a high-speed motor vehicle collision 8 months ago. She was driving home from work when another car ran a red light and struck the driver\u2019s side. She reports being trapped briefly, believing she would die, and witnessing the other driver bleeding and unresponsive until emergency responders arrived. She sustained a concussion and rib fractures; her physical injuries have healed, but she describes ongoing psychological symptoms.\n\nIntrusive symptoms: She reports recurrent, involuntary, distressing memories of the collision occurring \"out of nowhere,\" especially when hearing screeching brakes or sirens. She endorses recurrent nightmares 3\u20134 nights per week in which she \"sees the headlights coming\" and wakes in a panic, sweating and tachycardic. She describes occasional episodes while driving as a passenger where she feels \"like I\u2019m back in the car\" for seconds to a minute, during which she grips the seat, becomes disoriented, and then feels ashamed afterward. She has marked physiologic reactivity (heart racing, nausea, trembling) when passing intersections similar to the crash site.\n\nAvoidance: She actively avoids driving and has not driven since the accident, despite previously commuting daily. She refuses to ride in the front passenger seat and avoids the route where the crash occurred. She avoids conversations about the collision and becomes tearful or shuts down when family members ask about the legal/insurance process. She has stopped watching news or shows that include car crashes.\n\nChanges in cognition and mood related to the event: She reports persistent negative beliefs about safety and herself: \"The world isn\u2019t safe,\" and \"I should have seen it coming.\" She endorses ongoing guilt and self-blame about surviving while the other driver died, stating, \"I don\u2019t deserve to be okay.\" She describes emotional numbing and diminished ability to experience positive feelings: \"Even when my kid is laughing, it feels far away.\" She feels detached from her spouse and friends, rarely socializes, and reports decreased interest in previously enjoyed activities (baking, weekend outings). She notes patchy memory for parts of the immediate aftermath of the collision (e.g., \"I can\u2019t remember the moments right after impact\"), though she remains oriented with intact memory for other life events.\n\nArousal/reactivity symptoms: She reports chronic hypervigilance in public and in cars, constantly scanning for danger. She endorses exaggerated startle response to loud sounds, irritability, and snapping at family members \"over nothing.\" Sleep is markedly disrupted by difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings; she averages 4\u20135 hours/night. She reports poor concentration at work, making errors in routine tasks and needing to recheck work repeatedly. She also describes restlessness and tension, with intermittent headaches and muscle tightness.\n\nDepressive syndrome: Over the past 3\u20134 months, she has developed persistent low mood \"most of the day, nearly every day\" with anhedonia. She reports a significant drop in energy and motivation, stating, \"It takes everything to get out of bed.\" Appetite has decreased with an unintentional 10-lb weight loss over ~2 months. She endorses feelings of worthlessness and excessive guilt extending beyond the collision (\"I\u2019m a burden; my family would be better off without me\"). She describes psychomotor slowing noted by her spouse (\"She moves like she\u2019s stuck in mud\") and reports difficulty thinking and making decisions at work. She endorses passive thoughts of death several times per week (\"If I didn\u2019t wake up, it might be easier\") and one episode of considering taking an excessive amount of her prescribed pain medication approximately 6 weeks ago; she denies current intent or plan, denies preparatory behaviors, and agrees to safety planning and restricting access to medications.\n\nCourse, impairment, and context: Symptoms have persisted for more than 6 months after the collision and have intensified over the last several months, leading to significant impairment. She is on a performance improvement plan at work due to mistakes and missed deadlines. She has avoided driving, increasing dependence on her spouse for transportation and childcare logistics, contributing to marital strain. She has withdrawn from friends and family and reports reduced engagement in parenting activities.\n\nMedical/substance/medication factors: She denies current substance misuse. She takes only occasional ibuprofen; no steroids or stimulants. She denies thyroid disease or other medical explanation for symptoms. No evidence of delirium or psychosis. She denies past periods of abnormally elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, pressured speech, or risky behavior.\n\nMental status (abbreviated): Appears stated age; tearful at times; psychomotor slowing; mood \"empty\" with constricted affect. Thought process linear; thought content notable for guilt and passive death wishes without current plan/intent. No hallucinations or delusions. Cognition grossly intact though concentration reduced. Insight and judgment fair.\n\nRisk: Passive suicidal ideation with past consideration of overdose; no current plan or intent; protective factors include child, spouse, and willingness to engage in treatment. Safety plan initiated and follow-up arranged.",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concerns: \u201cI can\u2019t shut my brain off\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t feel like myself.\u201d\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient reports a long-standing pattern of excessive worry that has been present most days for approximately 8\u20139 months. Worries are described as pervasive and difficult to control, spanning multiple domains including job performance (fear of making mistakes and being fired), finances (catastrophic thoughts about unexpected bills), her child\u2019s health/safety (frequent mental images of accidents), and relationship stability (\u201cI keep thinking I\u2019m failing as a partner\u201d). She describes spending hours mentally reviewing conversations and checking for errors, and says, \u201cEven when nothing is happening, my body feels on alert.\u201d She tries to reassure herself, makes lists, and asks her spouse for reassurance, but the worry returns quickly. She reports associated symptoms occurring on most days: feeling keyed up and restless (\u201cI\u2019m constantly bracing for bad news\u201d), easy fatigability by mid-afternoon, difficulty concentrating (\u201cI read the same email five times and still don\u2019t absorb it\u201d), irritability with family (\u201cI snap and then hate myself for it\u201d), muscle tension in her neck/shoulders with frequent headaches, and sleep disturbance characterized by difficulty falling asleep due to rumination and frequent early-morning awakenings.\n\nOver the past 5 weeks, she has developed a distinct downturn in mood and functioning, which she describes as \u201ca heavy, numb sadness\u201d present nearly every day most of the day. She also reports markedly reduced interest and pleasure: she has stopped exercising, avoids social contact, and no longer enjoys activities she previously valued (baking and weekend outings). She reports low energy, psychomotor slowing (\u201cI move like I\u2019m underwater\u201d), and diminished motivation to complete routine tasks such as laundry and meal preparation. Concentration has worsened beyond her baseline worry-related distractibility; she has made multiple minor bookkeeping errors at work and is behind on deadlines, leading to a written warning. She endorses feelings of worthlessness and excessive guilt (\u201cMy family would be better off with someone who isn\u2019t so broken\u201d), and recurrent negative self-appraisals. She notes appetite has decreased with unintentional weight loss of about 6 pounds over the last month. Sleep is nonrestorative with early awakening and difficulty returning to sleep. She endorses passive thoughts of death on several occasions in the last two weeks (\u201cSometimes I think it would be easier not to wake up\u201d), but denies intent, plan, preparatory behavior, or access to firearms. She identifies her child as a strong protective factor and agrees to seek help if thoughts intensify.\n\nFunctional impact: She reports significant impairment in occupational functioning (reduced productivity, errors, avoidance of tasks), social withdrawal, and strain in her marriage due to irritability and reassurance-seeking. She avoids driving on highways due to fear-based rumination about accidents and has missed several family events because she feels \u201ctoo exhausted\u201d and worries she will \u201cruin the mood.\u201d\n\nPsychiatric/medical history: No prior psychiatric hospitalizations. She attended brief counseling in college for stress but no sustained treatment. No history of episodes of abnormally elevated or expansive mood, decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, or risky behavior. Denies hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia. Denies current or past panic attacks that are unexpected and recurrent. Medical history notable only for episodic tension headaches; recent primary care evaluation reportedly normal, including thyroid testing. No current medications other than occasional ibuprofen. \n\nSubstance use: Denies alcohol misuse, cannabis, stimulants, or other illicit substances. No recent medication changes.\n\nFamily and psychosocial context: Family history includes a parent described as \u201ca worrier\u201d and a sibling with prior treatment for mood symptoms. She reports increased work demands over the last year and ongoing childcare stress, but states the mood decline feels disproportionate to any single event and has persisted despite attempts at rest and support.\n\nMental status (summary): Appears tired with constricted affect; mood described as \u201csad and on edge.\u201d Thought process linear but ruminative. No psychosis. Cognition grossly intact though attention is impaired by worry. Insight and judgment fair. Safety: passive death wishes without plan/intent; agrees to a safety plan and follow-up.",
