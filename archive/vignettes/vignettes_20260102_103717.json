    "clinical_text": "Ms. A is a 34-year-old elementary school teacher presenting for evaluation due to 6 weeks of progressively worsening low mood and functional decline. She reports feeling \"sad and heavy all day, nearly every day\" and says that even when she tries to distract herself, \"it doesn\u2019t lift.\" She describes marked loss of interest in activities she previously enjoyed (reading novels, jogging, and playing with her child): \"I used to look forward to weekends\u2014now I just want to stay in bed.\" She notes significant fatigue: \"I\u2019m exhausted no matter how much I rest.\" \n\nShe endorses insomnia with early-morning awakening for the past month, typically waking around 3\u20134 a.m. and being unable to return to sleep. She reports decreased appetite with an unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds over the last 5\u20136 weeks. She describes psychomotor slowing observed by others: \"My husband says I move like I\u2019m in slow motion,\" and she feels it takes great effort to complete routine tasks such as showering and preparing lessons.\n\nCognitively, she reports poor concentration and indecisiveness at work: \"I read the same email three times and it still doesn\u2019t register.\" She has missed multiple deadlines, has called in sick twice in the last two weeks, and worries she is \"letting the kids down.\" She endorses excessive guilt and feelings of worthlessness disproportionate to events: \"I feel like a terrible mom and a failure as a teacher,\" despite colleagues telling her she is usually reliable and effective.\n\nShe acknowledges recurrent thoughts of death and passive suicidal ideation: \"Sometimes I think it would be easier if I just didn\u2019t wake up.\" Over the past week, she has had intermittent thoughts of \"ending it\" but denies a specific plan or intent, stating, \"I don\u2019t want to hurt my family.\" She denies access to firearms and denies prior suicide attempts. She denies hallucinations, delusional beliefs, or paranoia.\n\nThere is no history of periods of abnormally elevated or expansive mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, pressured speech, racing thoughts, increased goal-directed activity, impulsive spending, or other episodes suggestive of mania or hypomania. She denies recent substance use changes, including stimulants or steroids. She denies recent bereavement; she identifies no single triggering event, though she reports chronic work stress. Medical history is unremarkable; she denies thyroid disease, recent infections, or neurologic symptoms. Current medications include only an oral contraceptive; she is not taking over-the-counter weight-loss agents or supplements. Family history is notable for a mother with recurrent depressive episodes.\n\nOn mental status examination, she appears tired and mildly disheveled, with slowed movements. Speech is soft and slowed but coherent. Mood is \"down\"; affect is constricted and tearful at times. Thought process is linear. Thought content is notable for guilt, hopelessness, and passive suicidal ideation without plan or intent. No homicidal ideation. Cognition is grossly intact, but attention is reduced. Insight and judgment are fair. Symptoms have been present most days for more than two weeks and are causing clinically significant distress and impairment in occupational performance and family functioning.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. L is a 34-year-old project manager who presents for evaluation of persistent anxiety and worry that she describes as \"constant\" and \"hard to shut off\" for the past 9\u201310 months. She reports excessive worry occurring on most days about multiple areas of life, including job performance and deadlines, her child's health and safety, finances, and the possibility of making mistakes or disappointing others. She states, \"Even when things are fine, my brain finds something else to worry about.\" She reports difficulty controlling the worry, noting that reassurance and checking provide only brief relief before the worry returns.\n\nAssociated symptoms include feeling keyed up and restless (\"I\u2019m on edge all the time\"), easy fatigability (she feels mentally and physically drained by mid-afternoon), difficulty concentrating (\"I read the same email three times and still miss things\"), irritability (snapping at her spouse and coworkers), muscle tension (tight neck/shoulders with frequent jaw clenching), and sleep disturbance (trouble falling asleep due to ruminative thoughts and waking early with worry). She reports these symptoms have been present for months and occur on most days.\n\nShe describes functional impairment: she spends excessive time rechecking work, has missed deadlines due to over-preparing, avoids delegating tasks, and feels less effective at work. At home, she reports being \"short-tempered\" and less present with her child, and she has reduced social activities because \"I can\u2019t relax and I\u2019m too tired.\" She denies panic attacks, obsessions/compulsions, trauma-related flashbacks/nightmares, or specific social-performance fears as the primary driver of symptoms. She endorses occasional GI upset when anxious but no significant weight loss or gain.\n\nMood is described as \"stressed and overwhelmed\"; she denies persistent depressed mood or anhedonia as primary symptoms. She denies current or past manic/hypomanic episodes (no periods of abnormally elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, or risky behavior). She denies hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized thinking. She denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.\n\nMedical history is unremarkable aside from episodic tension headaches. She is not taking stimulants, steroids, or thyroid medication. She denies increased alcohol use and denies cannabis or other substances. Recent primary care visit reportedly included normal thyroid testing and basic labs. No evidence of a medical condition or substance effect explaining the anxiety.\n\nMental status examination: well-groomed, cooperative, mildly fidgety. Speech normal rate and volume. Affect anxious and congruent. Thought process linear but preoccupied with \"what if\" concerns. No psychosis. Cognition grossly intact though attention is subjectively impaired by worry. Insight and judgment fair.\n\nOverall presentation is notable for excessive, difficult-to-control worry across multiple domains occurring more days than not for >6 months, accompanied by multiple physical/cognitive symptoms and causing clinically significant distress and impairment.",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \u201cI can\u2019t stay on track\u2014I start things and then my brain jumps somewhere else.\u201d\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient reports a long-standing pattern of distractibility, disorganization, and restlessness that has become more impairing in his current role coordinating multiple projects with frequent deadlines. He describes making \u201ccareless mistakes\u201d in emails and scheduling (e.g., wrong dates, missing key details), despite understanding the tasks. He reports difficulty sustaining attention during meetings and while reading documentation: \u201cI\u2019ll read the same paragraph five times and still not absorb it.\u201d He frequently \u201ctunes out\u201d in conversations, stating his partner will say, \u201cYou\u2019re not listening,\u201d and he realizes he missed what was said.\n\nHe endorses difficulty following through on tasks: he starts drafting plans or updating trackers but leaves items unfinished, especially when tasks require sustained mental effort. He reports chronic disorganization (messy workspace, scattered notes across apps, missed action items), poor time management, and underestimating how long tasks will take. He avoids or procrastinates on tasks requiring prolonged focus (e.g., budget reviews, long reports), describing them as \u201cpainful to start.\u201d He frequently loses items needed for tasks (badge, earbuds, charging cables, keys) and relies heavily on reminders; even so, he forgets obligations such as appointments and responding to messages. He is easily distracted by notifications and background activity: \u201cIf someone walks by or Slack pings, I\u2019m gone.\u201d\n\nIn addition, he describes prominent restlessness and impulsive behaviors. He fidgets, taps his foot, and shifts in his chair throughout the interview. He reports feeling internally \u201cdriven\u201d and has difficulty staying seated through long meetings, often standing or pacing. He talks more than he intends to and catches himself interrupting: \u201cI blurt things out before people finish.\u201d He has trouble waiting his turn in discussions and will interject or complete others\u2019 sentences, later regretting it. He describes impatience in lines and while driving, though he denies road rage, accidents, or reckless speeding.\n\nCourse and onset: Symptoms began in childhood and were present before age 12. He recalls frequent teacher comments such as \u201cbright but doesn\u2019t apply himself,\u201d \u201cdaydreams,\u201d and \u201ctalks too much.\u201d He often forgot to turn in homework he had completed, lost school supplies, and needed repeated reminders to finish chores. He reports academic performance was inconsistent\u2014doing well on subjects he found interesting but struggling with sustained reading and longer assignments. His mother (contacted with his permission) corroborates longstanding patterns of forgetfulness, losing items, interrupting, and needing constant prompting to stay on task.\n\nSettings and impairment: Symptoms occur across multiple settings (work, home, and social situations). At work, he has received feedback about missed details, late follow-through, and \u201cseeming distracted\u201d in meetings. He has been placed on a performance improvement plan due to deadline slippage and incomplete documentation. At home, his partner reports he forgets shared plans, leaves chores half-finished, and appears not to listen, leading to conflict. Socially, friends comment that he dominates conversations, changes topics abruptly, and interrupts.\n\nCompensatory strategies: He uses multiple calendars, alarms, and sticky notes and has tried productivity apps; these help briefly but he struggles to maintain systems consistently. He drinks 1\u20132 coffees daily and denies use of illicit stimulants.\n\nPsychiatric review: He denies episodes of elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, or increased goal-directed activity suggestive of mania/hypomania. He denies persistent depressed mood or anhedonia; he reports situational stress and frustration related to performance but no sustained depressive syndrome. He denies panic attacks, intrusive obsessions/compulsions, trauma-related flashbacks, hallucinations, or delusions. He denies current suicidal or homicidal ideation.\n\nMedical/substance history: No history of seizures or significant head injury. Sleep is 6\u20137 hours/night; he reports difficulty \u201cshutting off\u201d thoughts at bedtime on some nights but no chronic insomnia. Alcohol: 1\u20132 drinks on weekends; denies blackouts. Denies tobacco, cannabis, or other substances. No current medications.\n\nMental status exam (brief): Alert and oriented; cooperative. Speech normal rate/volume, occasionally rapid when excited. Mood \u201cstressed\u201d; affect congruent. Thought process generally linear but tangential at times, requiring redirection. No psychosis. Attention is variable; he requests repetition of questions and is easily pulled by noises in the hallway. Insight and judgment intact.\n\nClinical impression: The presentation reflects a persistent pattern of inattention and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors with childhood onset, present across settings, causing clear functional impairment, and not better accounted for by another psychiatric or medical condition based on the history provided.",

    "clinical_text": "A 32-year-old emergency department nurse presents for evaluation of persistent anxiety, sleep disturbance, and functional decline following a traumatic workplace event. Eight months ago, she was involved in a mass-casualty incident in which multiple critically injured patients arrived simultaneously; she reports directly witnessing severe injuries and death, including performing prolonged resuscitation efforts on a teenager who died despite intervention. She states, \u201cI can still see his face when I close my eyes. I smell the blood sometimes like it\u2019s happening again.\u201d\n\nSince the event, she describes recurrent, involuntary, and distressing memories occurring \u201cmultiple times a day,\u201d with vivid mental images and sensory details. She endorses nightmares 3\u20135 nights per week about \u201cbeing trapped in the trauma bay and nobody can hear me,\u201d waking in a panic and drenched in sweat. She reports episodes at work where she briefly feels as if the event is recurring: \u201cWhen the ambulance doors open and I hear the monitor alarms, it\u2019s like I\u2019m back there. My body reacts before my brain catches up.\u201d During these episodes she experiences intense fear, palpitations, shaking, and shortness of breath. She reports marked distress and physiological reactivity when exposed to reminders such as sirens, monitor beeps, the smell of antiseptic, or seeing teenagers in the ED: \u201cMy heart starts racing and I have to fight the urge to run out.\u201d\n\nShe reports persistent avoidance of reminders. She has switched from trauma-bay shifts to a lower-acuity area and calls in sick when she anticipates high-volume nights. She avoids driving past the site of the incident staging area and refuses to watch news coverage of accidents or violence. She also avoids discussing the event with coworkers and family: \u201cIf I start talking about it, I feel like I\u2019m going to lose control, so I shut it down.\u201d\n\nShe describes negative changes in mood and thinking that began after the incident. She reports persistent guilt and self-blame: \u201cI keep thinking I should have done more\u2026 I must have missed something.\u201d She endorses a persistent negative emotional state with fear, shame, and anger, describing herself as \u201con edge and numb at the same time.\u201d She reports diminished interest in previously enjoyable activities (stopped running with friends and rarely plays with her dog), emotional detachment from her spouse (\u201cI\u2019m just not there; I feel disconnected\u201d), and an inability to experience positive emotions: \u201cEven when something good happens, I can\u2019t feel happy\u2014just flat.\u201d She denies persistent depressive symptoms predating the event and denies current suicidal ideation, intent, or plan.\n\nShe also reports increased arousal and reactivity: difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings, irritability with verbal outbursts (\u201cI snap at my husband over nothing\u201d), hypervigilance in public places (\u201cI scan exits in restaurants and can\u2019t sit with my back to the door\u201d), an exaggerated startle response to sudden noises, and problems with concentration (\u201cI reread the same chart three times and still can\u2019t focus\u201d). She denies reckless or self-destructive behaviors.\n\nSymptoms have been present for more than six months, occurring most days, and have caused clinically significant distress and impairment. She reports decreased work performance, increased sick days, and conflict in her marriage. She is not taking any new medications, denies illicit drug use, and reports no recent increase in alcohol intake. There is no history suggestive of a primary psychotic disorder or manic episode; she recognizes that the intrusive experiences are related to the traumatic event and does not endorse fixed delusional beliefs. No acute medical issues are reported that would better explain the symptoms.",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \"I think I have anxiety. I keep rehearsing conversations and I feel on edge at work.\"\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient presents for evaluation at the urging of her manager after several workplace conflicts and increasing distress during team meetings. She reports episodes she labels as \"anxiety\" that intensify in situations involving unstructured social expectations (e.g., informal discussions, office celebrations, sudden changes in meeting agendas) and in environments with high sensory load (open-plan office noise, fluorescent lighting). She describes feeling tense and preoccupied before meetings, stating, \"If I don\u2019t know exactly what I\u2019m supposed to say, my brain freezes,\" and \"I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll miss a cue and everyone will think I\u2019m rude.\" The preoccupation is described as focused on predicting specific social outcomes and preventing misunderstandings rather than multiple unrelated life domains. She denies persistent, free-floating worry about finances, health, world events, or a wide range of everyday matters. She also denies that the worry feels globally uncontrollable; instead she reports it decreases significantly when she is given written agendas, explicit role expectations, or remote participation options.\n\nShe reports a lifelong pattern of difficulty interpreting others\u2019 intentions unless stated directly: \"I don\u2019t pick up hints,\" and \"People say I\u2019m blunt, but I\u2019m just being accurate.\" She describes challenges with back-and-forth conversation, noting she can speak at length about preferred topics but struggles to notice when others are disengaged: \"If someone asks about bugs in the build, I can explain for 20 minutes. Later I realize they just wanted a yes/no.\" In friendships and dating, she reports misreading sarcasm, difficulty with small talk, and uncertainty about relationship boundaries; she maintains one close friend from college with whom she mostly communicates by text.\n\nBehavioral patterns and interests: She reports strong preferences for predictability and routines, including eating the same breakfast daily and arranging her workspace in a specific order; she becomes distressed by unexpected changes, describing \"a spike of panic\" when meetings are moved without notice. She describes time-consuming, highly focused interests in train timetables and data visualization, stating she can spend hours organizing information \"because it feels calming and makes sense.\" She notes repetitive self-soothing behaviors under stress, including rocking slightly in her chair and rubbing her fingertips together; she attempts to suppress these at work to avoid comments.\n\nSensory features: She reports longstanding sensitivity to sound and tactile stimuli. She avoids crowded restaurants due to overlapping conversations and clattering dishes, describing it as \"painful\" and leading to irritability and shutdown. She prefers specific clothing fabrics and removes tags due to discomfort. At the office, she uses noise-canceling headphones and asks to dim her monitor brightness; she reports headaches and fatigue after days with heavy in-person interaction.\n\nDevelopmental history: When asked about childhood, she reports being \"the quiet kid\" who preferred solitary play and organizing objects. Her mother (contacted with patient permission) recalls she spoke early but \"talked like a little professor,\" corrected adults, and had intense, narrow interests (memorizing transit maps). She had difficulty with peer play, often \"lecturing\" or insisting on specific rules; she was teased for being \"weird\" and tended to eat lunch alone. She had notable distress with transitions (e.g., substitute teachers, schedule changes) and frequent meltdowns at home after school that the family attributed to being \"overwhelmed.\" No history of language delay requiring intervention was reported, though pragmatic communication difficulties were noted.\n\nCurrent functioning and impairment: At work, she is technically strong but receives feedback about communication style, rigidity, and difficulty adapting to shifting priorities. She reports exhaustion after masking and increased sick days following days with high social demands. In daily life, she manages independent living but relies on strict routines for shopping and chores, and becomes overwhelmed in unfamiliar settings. She reports sleep is generally adequate unless a major change is expected; on those nights she has difficulty initiating sleep due to mentally reviewing the upcoming interaction.\n\nAnxiety-related symptoms and differential considerations: She endorses somatic tension, restlessness, and occasional nausea before socially demanding or sensory-heavy events. These symptoms are situation-linked and improve with environmental accommodations, clear instructions, and predictable schedules. She denies chronic, excessive worry occurring more days than not about numerous areas of life. She does not report panic attacks that occur unexpectedly; episodes are reliably triggered by specific contexts (crowded spaces, ambiguous social tasks, sudden changes). She denies compulsions aimed at neutralizing intrusive thoughts, and denies intrusive ego-dystonic thoughts. She denies depressed mood most days, anhedonia, or suicidal ideation. She reports occasional irritability and shutdown when overstimulated, followed by relief when in a quiet space.\n\nMental status exam: Well-groomed, cooperative. Eye contact intermittent and often directed away while thinking. Speech fluent with formal phrasing; prosody somewhat monotone. Affect mildly constricted but appropriate; mood described as \"stressed.\" Thought process linear and detail-focused; content without delusions or hallucinations. No manic symptoms. Insight fair; she attributes many conflicts to \"people assuming things I didn\u2019t mean.\" Cognition grossly intact. Judgment adequate.\n\nSummary impression: Presentation features a lifelong pattern of social-communication differences across contexts, restricted/repetitive behaviors and insistence on sameness, and sensory sensitivities with functional impairment. Anxiety symptoms are prominent but appear secondary to predictable triggers (social ambiguity, change, sensory overload) rather than generalized, pervasive worry across multiple domains.",

She states, \"I wake up already dreading the day, and I can't shake this sadness.\" She also endorses markedly diminished interest and pleasure: \"I used to love planning lessons and going for runs. Now nothing feels worth doing.\" \n\nShe reports low energy and fatigue daily, describing that routine tasks feel exhausting and she has been calling in sick and leaving work early. She notes impaired concentration and indecisiveness: \"I read the same email three times and still can't process it,\" and says grading papers takes far longer than usual. Sleep is disturbed with early-morning awakening (waking around 4 a.m. and unable to return to sleep) nearly every night.

She denies any prior suicide attempts. She identifies protective factors including her spouse, close relationship with her sister, and desire not to harm her students or family, and agrees to safety planning and increased monitoring.\n\nSymptoms are causing clinically significant distress and functional impairment, including missed workdays, decreased performance, social withdrawal, and reduced self-care. She denies any history of manic or hypomanic episodes (no periods of abnormally elevated or irritable mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, pressured speech, racing thoughts, inflated self-esteem, risky behavior, or markedly increased goal-directed activity). She denies hallucinations or delusional beliefs. She denies panic attacks as the primary issue; anxiety is present but secondary to the pervasive low mood. \n\nShe reports no recent substance use changes and denies stimulant, opioid, or sedative misuse. She is not taking corticosteroids or other medications associated with mood changes. Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable; she reports a recent primary care visit with normal basic labs including thyroid function. There is no evidence that symptoms are better explained by a medical condition. She reports no recent bereavement; the onset followed a period of increasing workplace stress and feelings of being overwhelmed, but symptoms are persistent and pervasive beyond situational triggers.",

    "clinical_text": "A 34-year-old high school teacher presents for evaluation of persistent anxiety and worry that she describes as \"constant background noise\" for the past 10\u201311 months. She reports excessive worry occurring most days about multiple areas of life, including her job performance (e.g., lesson observations, grading), her children\u2019s safety and health, finances, and the possibility of making mistakes that could \"ruin everything.\" She states, \"Even when nothing is happening, my mind jumps to worst-case scenarios.\" She finds the worry difficult to control and notes that reassurance provides only brief relief before new worries emerge.\n\nShe endorses associated physical and cognitive symptoms occurring on most days: feeling keyed up and restless (\"I can\u2019t relax; I\u2019m always bracing for something\"), becoming easily fatigued by midday despite adequate effort to rest, difficulty concentrating (\"I reread emails three times and still doubt what I wrote\"), irritability with family and coworkers (\"I snap over small things\"), muscle tension in her shoulders and jaw with frequent headaches, and sleep disturbance characterized by difficulty falling asleep due to racing thoughts and waking early to \"mentally review\" tasks. She reports that these symptoms have gradually intensified over the last year and are not confined to specific situations.\n\nFunctionally, she reports significant distress and impairment: she spends excessive time checking school communications, repeatedly reviews household expenses, and frequently seeks reassurance from her spouse. She has begun arriving to work early to \"double-check everything,\" leading to reduced time with family and missed social plans due to feeling overwhelmed. She denies panic attacks, discrete episodes of sudden intense fear, or avoidance specifically related to social scrutiny. She denies obsessions with repetitive compulsions beyond checking driven by worry; her checking is described as an attempt to reduce persistent worry rather than a fixed ritual. She denies trauma-related intrusive memories or hypervigilance tied to a specific event. Mood is described as \"stressed and on edge\" but she denies persistent depressed mood or loss of interest most days; appetite is stable. She denies manic or hypomanic symptoms. She denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.\n\nShe reports no recent medication changes and denies use of stimulants, diet pills, or illicit substances. She has no symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism (no heat intolerance, tremor, unexplained weight loss) and no cardiopulmonary complaints other than occasional tension-related chest tightness during worry. Mental status exam: appropriately dressed, cooperative, normal speech, mood \"anxious,\" affect congruent and tense, thought process linear but ruminative, thought content notable for excessive worries across domains, no psychosis, cognition grossly intact though she reports subjective concentration difficulty, insight and judgment fair. She is seeking help because she feels the worry is \"taking over\" and interfering with her work and home life.",

    "clinical_text": "CC: \"My mind never shuts up, and I keep dropping the ball at work. I\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to get fired.\"\n\nHPI: The patient is a 29-year-old project coordinator referred for evaluation due to chronic difficulties with attention, organization, and task completion that have become more impairing after a recent promotion requiring independent planning and tracking of multiple deadlines. She reports longstanding patterns of misplacing items (\"I lose my keys at least three times a week\"), forgetting obligations unless they are immediately entered into her phone, and missing details in emails despite rereading them. She describes frequently starting tasks with strong intention but drifting to another activity within minutes (\"I\u2019ll open a spreadsheet, then somehow I\u2019m reorganizing folders, then I\u2019m Googling something random\"). She endorses significant procrastination, especially for tasks requiring sustained mental effort (budgets, long reports), and describes \"last-minute sprints\" to meet deadlines. She notes that even during meetings she must \"fight to stay with it,\" often realizing she has missed parts of the conversation and later asking colleagues to repeat information.\n\nShe describes internal restlessness and difficulty remaining seated through longer meetings, frequently fidgeting with pens, tapping her foot, or switching positions. She reports that she often answers before others finish speaking and later regrets sounding \"abrupt.\" She describes interrupting her partner and coworkers when she feels she will \"lose the thought\" if she does not say it immediately. She denies risky driving, spending sprees, or episodes of elevated mood.\n\nThe patient also reports feeling \"on edge\" and experiencing frequent worry, but when asked to elaborate she links the worry primarily to predictable consequences of disorganization and missed tasks: \"I\u2019m not worried about everything\u2014mostly I\u2019m worried I forgot something.\" She reports the worry spikes after she notices an unread email thread, an approaching deadline, or when she cannot find an important item. She describes repeated checking behaviors (refreshing her inbox, re-reading sent messages, reviewing her calendar) that she experiences as attempts to compensate for forgetfulness rather than rituals driven by intrusive fears. She denies persistent, hard-to-control worry across multiple life domains (finances, health, family safety) on most days; she states, \"If my system is working, I\u2019m actually pretty calm.\" She denies muscle tension most days, denies chronic gastrointestinal symptoms related to worry, and denies panic attacks. Sleep is inconsistent; she reports staying up late \"trying to catch up\" or becoming distracted by other activities (scrolling, organizing, side projects), rather than being kept awake by pervasive worry.\n\nCourse/Onset: She reports similar difficulties since childhood. She recalls being described as \"bright but scattered\" by teachers and frequently receiving comments such as \"does not use time wisely\" and \"talks in class.\" She states she often forgot to turn in completed homework and lost worksheets. Her mother, contacted with consent, reports the patient was \"always daydreaming,\" misplaced belongings, and needed repeated reminders for chores. The patient reports that symptoms were present well before age 12. She describes impairment across settings: at work (missed deadlines, errors of omission, difficulty prioritizing), at home (unfinished chores, clutter, forgetting appointments), and in her relationship (partner feels she \"isn\u2019t listening\" and is frustrated by interruptions and inconsistent follow-through).\n\nPsychiatric history: No prior psychiatric hospitalizations. Brief counseling in college for academic stress. No history of trauma-related nightmares or avoidance symptoms. No history of psychosis. Denies past episodes of markedly decreased need for sleep with increased goal-directed activity or grandiosity. \n\nMedical history: Unremarkable; no thyroid disease reported. Medications: combined oral contraceptive only. Allergies: none known.\n\nSubstance history: Drinks 1\u20132 alcoholic beverages on weekends. Caffeine: 2\u20133 coffees daily, sometimes more when behind. Denies cannabis, stimulants, or other illicit drugs.\n\nFamily history: Father described as \"disorganized\" and chronically late; no formal diagnoses. Maternal aunt with history of depression.\n\nMental status exam (abbrev.): Well-groomed, cooperative. Speech normal rate/volume; occasionally tangential but redirectable. Mood \"stressed\"; affect mildly anxious but reactive. Thought process linear overall with moments of circumstantiality. No suicidal or homicidal ideation. No delusions or hallucinations. Cognition: alert and oriented; working memory appears strained during serial tasks; attention variable. Insight and judgment fair.\n\nClinical impression: Lifelong and pervasive pattern of inattention (difficulty sustaining attention, disorganization, procrastination, losing items, forgetfulness, failure to follow through) with associated restlessness and impulsive conversational style, causing functional impairment in occupational and interpersonal domains. Reported worry appears largely secondary to repeated lapses and performance consequences, fluctuates with external demands, and is not described as excessive, pervasive, or uncontrollable across multiple domains.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. R is a 32-year-old paramedic referred by occupational health for persistent sleep disturbance, irritability, and anxiety that began after a call 5 months ago. She reports responding to a multi-vehicle collision in which a driver was trapped and severely injured. She describes being unable to free the driver before the vehicle caught fire and states, \"I can still hear him yelling and the smell of smoke hits me out of nowhere.\" She reports that during the event she felt \"frozen\" and afterward had a sense of unreality and \"watching myself from outside.\" She denies prior similar symptoms before this incident.\n\nSince the call, she endorses recurrent, involuntary distressing memories that occur daily, often triggered by sirens, the smell of gasoline, or seeing wrecked cars. She reports nightmares 3\u20134 nights per week with themes of being trapped or unable to help someone; she wakes sweating and disoriented and sometimes checks her apartment for smoke. She describes episodes in which she briefly feels \"back there on scene,\" lasting seconds to a minute, during which she loses awareness of her surroundings and then \"snaps out of it\" with strong fear. She avoids driving on highways and refuses to ride in the front passenger seat. She has called out sick to avoid shift work that involves motor vehicle collisions and states, \"If dispatch says crash, my stomach drops and I try to trade calls.\" She also avoids news, videos, or conversations about traffic fatalities and becomes visibly tense when coworkers discuss similar calls.\n\nShe reports persistent negative mood and cognitions: guilt and self-blame (\"I should have done more; I failed him\"), diminished interest in hobbies (she stopped running and meeting friends), and feeling detached (\"I\u2019m there but not really there\"). She describes emotional numbing and difficulty experiencing positive emotions, stating, \"Even when something good happens, it doesn\u2019t land.\" She endorses persistent fear and anger, with increased irritability and verbal outbursts at work and at home. She reports hypervigilance (constantly scanning intersections and exits), exaggerated startle response to loud bangs or sirens, and difficulty concentrating (\"I read the same paragraph over and over\"). Sleep is fragmented with prolonged sleep onset and frequent awakenings.\n\nFunctionally, she has requested modified duty due to symptoms and has received a written warning for snapping at a supervisor and making documentation errors. Socially, she has withdrawn from friends and rarely leaves home except for errands. She reports occasional panic-like surges when exposed to triggers (heart racing, shortness of breath, trembling), typically lasting 10\u201315 minutes, and fears they will happen while driving. She has begun drinking 2\u20133 beers most nights to \"shut my brain off\"; she denies morning drinking, blackouts, or withdrawal symptoms but acknowledges increased tolerance. She denies current suicidal intent or plan; she endorses passive thoughts such as \"I wish I could just not wake up\" after nightmares, without intent, and cites fear of hurting family and career goals as protective factors.\n\nPast psychiatric history is notable for brief counseling in college for situational stress; no history of manic episodes, psychosis, or prior trauma-related symptoms. She denies head injury, seizures, or other medical contributors. She is not taking psychiatric medications. Mental status exam: cooperative, tearful at times; mood \"on edge\"; affect constricted and anxious; thought process linear; thought content notable for guilt and intrusive memories; no hallucinations or delusions; cognition grossly intact; insight and judgment fair. Symptoms have persisted for more than one month and cause clinically significant distress and impairment. She reports the symptoms are not solely attributable to alcohol use and predated the increase in drinking.",

    "clinical_text": "Reason for visit: Referred by university counseling after repeated complaints from peers and a professor that he seems \u201crude,\u201d \u201cuninterested,\u201d and \u201chard to talk to,\u201d and after he became highly distressed when a group-project schedule changed.\n\nHistory of presenting concerns: The patient reports long-standing difficulty understanding social expectations and maintaining reciprocal conversations. He states, \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019m supposed to talk. People say I\u2019m talking at them, not with them.\u201d During the interview he gives lengthy, detail-heavy answers focused on his preferred topics, with limited awareness of the clinician\u2019s cues to shift topics. He rarely asks questions back and often interprets questions literally (e.g., when asked how his mood has been, he replies with an exact description of his sleep schedule and caffeine intake rather than describing emotions). He reports being confused by sarcasm and indirect requests: \u201cIf someone says, \u2018It\u2019s cold in here,\u2019 I don\u2019t know if they want me to close the window or if they\u2019re just stating a fact.\u201d\n\nSocial communication/interaction: He describes persistent difficulty making and keeping friends despite wanting social connection: \u201cI want friends, but I don\u2019t know the steps.\u201d He prefers structured interactions around shared activities and struggles with unstructured socializing. He reports frequently missing nonverbal cues and being told his facial expression looks \u201cblank\u201d or \u201cserious\u201d even when he feels neutral. In session, eye contact is fleeting and not well integrated with speech; his gestures are minimal and somewhat stiff. He describes difficulty gauging others\u2019 interest: \u201cI can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re bored until they leave.\u201d He also reports past misunderstandings in dating attempts, saying he could not tell when someone was flirting versus being polite. He tends to stand too close without realizing and has been asked to \u201cgive space.\u201d\n\nRestricted/repetitive behaviors and interests: He reports a strong need for routines and becomes distressed by unexpected changes. He describes becoming \u201cpanicky and stuck\u201d when a class was moved to a different building, and he needed to walk the route repeatedly the night before to feel calm. He keeps a highly rigid daily schedule and eats the same lunch most days, stating, \u201cIf it\u2019s different, it feels wrong and I can\u2019t focus.\u201d He exhibits repetitive motor behaviors when anxious, including hand-flapping and rocking while seated; he acknowledges this and says, \u201cI do it to settle my nerves.\u201d He also describes repetitive speech patterns, including rehearsing specific scripts before phone calls and repeating phrases under his breath after conversations.\n\nHe has an intense, circumscribed interest in public transit systems and route optimization, present since childhood. He spends several hours daily mapping bus routes and tracking timetables, and he can recite route numbers and transfer times in great detail. He reports that this topic \u201cmakes sense and is calming,\u201d and that he often brings it up in conversation even when others are discussing unrelated matters. Roommates complain that he \u201cmonologues\u201d about it and becomes irritated if interrupted.\n\nSensory features: He describes strong sensory sensitivities, including discomfort with fluorescent lights (\u201cIt\u2019s like a buzzing in my head\u201d), certain fabric textures, and loud mixed-noise environments such as cafeterias (\u201cI can\u2019t separate the sounds; it feels painful\u201d). He wears noise-canceling headphones daily and avoids crowded dining halls, choosing to eat alone in a quiet area.\n\nDevelopmental history: Symptoms were present early. His mother (contacted with consent) reports he spoke his first words on time but had an unusual communication style, \u201ctalked like a little professor,\u201d and often lectured about his interests. She reports limited pretend play, a preference for lining up toy cars by size/color, and distress when routines changed. As a child he preferred solitary activities, had difficulty with playdates, and was frequently described by teachers as \u201cvery bright but socially unaware.\u201d He received social-skills support in elementary school due to peer relationship difficulties and frequent misunderstandings of classroom social rules.\n\nCurrent functioning and impairment: Academically he performs well in technical coursework but struggles in group projects, presentations requiring audience awareness, and networking. At work, he is reliable with tasks but has been coached about tone of voice and responding to patrons\u2019 small talk. He reports significant exhaustion after social interactions and increased anxiety when routines are disrupted. He denies current or past hallucinations, delusions, manic episodes, or panic attacks unrelated to change/sensory overload. Mood is generally \u201cokay,\u201d though he reports frustration and loneliness related to social difficulties. No history of self-harm. He denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.\n\nMental status examination (salient features): Appearance neat, behavior cooperative. Speech is fluent, sometimes overly formal, with occasional pedantic phrasing; prosody somewhat monotone. Affect constricted but appropriate to content. Thought process linear but overly detailed; content focused on schedules and transit details when given the opportunity. Insight into having social difficulties is partial; judgment intact for safety.\n\nDifferential considerations: Intellectual functioning appears average to above average based on academic history and vocabulary; there is no evidence that the social-communication deficits are better explained by global developmental delay. The pattern is longstanding, present since early childhood, pervasive across settings, and causes clinically significant functional impairment in social and occupational domains.",

She describes prominent fatigue (\u201cI feel like I\u2019m moving through wet cement\u201d), reduced concentration at work (double-checking charts repeatedly, forgetting routine tasks), and increased tearfulness. Sleep is disrupted with early-morning awakening (waking at 3\u20134 AM and unable to return to sleep) and occasional difficulty falling asleep due to ruminative thoughts about \u201cmessing everything up.\u201d Appetite is reduced with an unintentional 8 lb weight loss over the past month. She endorses feelings of worthlessness and excessive guilt disproportionate to events (\u201cI\u2019m a bad nurse\u2026 I ruin everything\u201d), and she has become increasingly indecisive.\n\nShe reports passive thoughts of death several times per week (\u201cSometimes I think it would be easier not to wake up\u201d), and in the last week she had fleeting thoughts of \u201ctaking a bunch of pills,\u201d but denies preparing, acquiring medications for that purpose, writing notes, or making plans. She denies intent, citing her partner and family as reasons for living. She agrees to a safety plan and means restriction. No history of suicide attempts or self-injury.\n\nHistory includes a distressing work incident about 5 months ago: a young patient died during a resuscitation despite prolonged efforts. Around the same period, she witnessed a separate event in the ED where an intoxicated visitor became aggressive and punched a staff member. She describes these as \u201cawful\u201d and says she felt shaken afterward. Because of this history, she worried she might be \u201ctraumatized.\u201d She endorses increased startle when hearing sudden loud noises in the hospital and some avoidance of watching medical dramas at home because they feel \u201ctoo heavy\u201d right now. However, she denies recurrent, intrusive, involuntary memories of either incident; denies flashbacks, dissociative episodes, or feeling as though the events are happening again. She denies persistent physiological reactivity or panic specifically triggered by reminders; instead, she describes a more constant low mood and pervasive negative self-appraisal. She has had a few unpleasant dreams in the past month, but they are nonspecific (themes of being late or failing at work) rather than reenactments of either event. She continues to work in the same ED, does not avoid the trauma-related location, and does not avoid discussions of the incidents during supervision; she states, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I can\u2019t talk about it\u2014I just feel hopeless all the time.\u201d She denies persistent hypervigilance outside of work, denies irritability or angry outbursts, and denies reckless/self-destructive behaviors.\n\nNo history of manic or hypomanic episodes: she denies periods of elevated/expansive mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, pressured speech, inflated self-esteem, racing thoughts, or risky spending/sexual behavior. She denies hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia. Anxiety symptoms are present but appear secondary to rumination and functional impairment; she does not report discrete panic attacks.\n\nPast psychiatric history: no prior formal treatment; reports one brief period of low mood in college after a breakup that resolved within 2 weeks without impairment. Medical history: mild asthma; no thyroid disease. Medications: albuterol PRN; no steroids recently. Substances: drinks 1\u20132 glasses of wine on weekends; denies binge drinking; denies cannabis or other substances. Family history: mother with recurrent depressive episodes. Social history: supportive partner; increasing social withdrawal over last 2 months; work performance has declined and she has used three sick days in the past month.\n\nMental status exam: well-groomed, slowed movements, soft speech.

    "clinical_text": "A 34-year-old married project coordinator presents for evaluation due to persistent anxiety and physical tension. She reports that for the past 10\u201312 months she has felt \"on edge most days,\" with worry that feels \"constant and exhausting.\" The worry occurs more days than not and spans multiple areas: fear of making mistakes at work (e.g., missing an email, misreading a schedule), finances (\"What if we can\u2019t cover daycare if something happens?\"), the health and safety of her child (e.g., mentally replaying possibilities of accidents or illness), and concerns about her spouse\u2019s job stability. She describes the worry as difficult to control: \"Even when I tell myself it\u2019s not rational, it keeps running like a playlist.\" She spends significant time seeking reassurance (checking messages repeatedly, rereading sent emails, reviewing calendars multiple times) and has trouble disengaging from \"what if\" thoughts at night.\n\nShe endorses several associated symptoms: (1) restlessness/feeling keyed up\u2014\"I can\u2019t relax; even on the couch my leg is bouncing\"; (2) easy fatigue\u2014she feels drained by mid-afternoon despite adequate opportunities to rest; (3) difficulty concentrating\u2014\"I read the same paragraph three times\" and at work she loses her train of thought during meetings; (4) irritability\u2014snappier with her spouse and child, followed by guilt; (5) muscle tension\u2014chronic tightness in her neck/jaw with occasional tension headaches; and (6) sleep disturbance\u2014difficulty falling asleep due to worry and intermittent early-morning awakening. She reports the symptoms have caused clinically significant distress and impairment: reduced productivity at work, avoidance of taking on new tasks, strained family interactions, and diminished enjoyment of leisure activities. She denies that these symptoms are limited to performance situations or social scrutiny; she worries even when alone and on weekends.\n\nNon-standard features include prominent gastrointestinal symptoms that fluctuate with stress (episodic abdominal cramping and loose stools), for which her primary care clinician previously suggested a functional bowel pattern; she notes, \"If I have a stressful meeting, my stomach goes crazy.\" She also describes occasional brief surges of anxiety with palpitations and shortness of breath (lasting 5\u201310 minutes) when she is already worrying, but these episodes are not unexpected out of the blue and do not lead to persistent fear of future attacks; rather, they are experienced as peaks of her ongoing tension.\n\nShe denies depressed mood most of the day nearly every day, anhedonia, or suicidal ideation, though she feels \"worn out\" and self-critical. She denies obsessions with ritualized compulsions, traumatic re-experiencing, discrete phobic triggers, or episodes of abnormally elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, or increased goal-directed activity. She reports no history of psychosis. She denies current or past problematic alcohol or drug use and is not using stimulants or weight-loss agents; she drinks one cup of coffee in the morning and occasionally a second at lunch.\n\nMedical history is notable only for episodic tension headaches and the stress-related gastrointestinal complaints; she has no known thyroid disease and no recent significant weight change. Current medications: none. She has not previously received psychiatric treatment. Family history is positive for a mother described as a \"worrier\" who was treated with medication for anxiety. Mental status examination: well-groomed, cooperative; speech normal rate/volume; mood \"anxious,\" affect tense but reactive; thought process linear with frequent anticipatory worry content; no delusions or hallucinations; cognition grossly intact though she reports subjective distractibility; insight and judgment fair. She is seeking help because she feels her worry is \"taking over\" and wants strategies and/or medication to regain control and improve sleep and functioning.",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \u201cMy brain feels like a browser with 30 tabs open. I\u2019m always behind, even when I\u2019m trying hard.\u201d\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient presents for evaluation of longstanding difficulties with attention regulation and organization that have become more impairing after a recent promotion requiring independent planning, frequent context-switching, and documentation. She reports persistent problems sustaining focus during meetings and while writing status updates: \u201cI read the same paragraph five times and still don\u2019t know what it says.\u201d She often starts tasks with good intentions but drifts to other activities (checking messages, reorganizing a spreadsheet, researching unrelated topics) and later realizes she did not complete the original assignment. She describes frequent careless mistakes in routine work (wrong dates on calendar invites, missing attachments, overlooking small instructions), and she tends to miss details unless she is under significant time pressure.\n\nShe reports that she \u201cmisplaces everything\u201d (badge, earbuds, keys) and keeps multiple sets of items to cope. She describes chronic difficulty organizing multi-step tasks, estimating time, and prioritizing: \u201cIf there are five tasks, they all feel equally urgent, and I freeze.\u201d She often procrastinates on sustained mental effort tasks such as expense reports, long emails, and preparing project documentation, describing them as \u201cphysically painful to start.\u201d She frequently forgets obligations unless they are immediately entered into reminders, including paying bills and responding to messages. Her partner corroborates that she leaves tasks half-finished at home (laundry started but not moved to the dryer, cooking begun then abandoned) and can appear not to listen when spoken to directly, especially if she is on her phone or thinking about something else.\n\nHyperactivity/impulsivity features are present but less prominent. She describes an internal sense of restlessness (\u201cI\u2019m buzzing inside\u201d) and fidgeting (foot tapping, picking at cuticles) during meetings. She gets up frequently to refill water or \u201cwalk a lap\u201d in the office. She talks rapidly when excited and sometimes interrupts: \u201cI blurt it out because if I wait, I\u2019ll forget.\u201d She denies impulsive spending sprees, reckless driving, or recurrent physical fights.\n\nCourse and developmental history: Symptoms are described as chronic and trace back to childhood. She recalls teacher comments in elementary school such as \u201cbright but daydreams\u201d and \u201cmissing homework even when she knows the material.\u201d She reports needing parental prompting to start and complete chores and school projects, frequently losing school supplies, and routinely doing assignments the night before they were due. She states the difficulties were present across settings (home and school) and continued through high school and college, where she relied on coping strategies including last-minute \u201call-nighters,\u201d heavy use of color-coded planners, and choosing classes based on perceived workload. Despite strong test performance, she struggled with sustained reading, lengthy writing assignments, and managing deadlines.\n\nCurrent impairment: At work, she reports being placed on a performance improvement plan focused on documentation quality, follow-through, and missed deadlines. She spends extra hours \u201cmaking up\u201d work after others leave, which has contributed to fatigue and conflict with her partner. At home, she reports household disorganization and frequent arguments about unfinished tasks and forgetfulness. She reports reduced self-esteem and guilt: \u201cI feel lazy, but I\u2019m not trying to be.\u201d\n\nAssociated symptoms and comorbidity considerations: She reports mild generalized worry about making mistakes at work and occasional difficulty falling asleep due to \u201creplaying the day,\u201d occurring several nights per week. She denies panic attacks. She denies persistent low mood most days, anhedonia, suicidal ideation, or history of self-harm. She denies episodes of abnormally elevated mood, decreased need for sleep with increased goal-directed activity, grandiosity, or other manic symptoms. She denies psychotic symptoms. She reports occasional use of cannabis (edible) 1\u20132 times per month \u201cto unwind,\u201d and drinks alcohol socially (1\u20133 drinks/week); she denies other substance use. Caffeine intake is 2\u20133 coffees daily. Sleep averages 6\u20137 hours on weekdays, longer on weekends.\n\nMedical history: No known thyroid disease, seizure history, or head injury with loss of consciousness. No current medications. No known medication allergies.\n\nFamily and psychosocial history: She reports a brother who \u201calways had trouble sitting still and barely got through school,\u201d never formally evaluated; mother described as chronically disorganized. She is in a stable relationship but notes increasing tension related to follow-through and forgetfulness. She enjoys exercise and hobbies but often abandons new projects after initial enthusiasm.\n\nMental status exam (summary): Well-groomed, cooperative. Speech normal volume, occasionally rapid when describing work issues. Mood \u201cstressed\u201d; affect congruent. Thought process generally linear but tangential when recounting recent events; easily redirected. No delusions or hallucinations. Cognition grossly intact; attention fluctuates during interview (asks for questions to be repeated once). Insight and judgment fair.\n\nClinical impression: Presentation is consistent with a chronic pattern of inattention with some restlessness, with onset in childhood, presence across settings, and clinically significant impairment. Mild generalized anxiety and sleep-onset insomnia appear secondary to ongoing functional stress and are not sufficient to account for the longstanding attentional and organizational difficulties. No evidence for a primary mood or psychotic disorder at this time.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. R is a 32-year-old paramedic referred by her primary care clinician for persistent anxiety, insomnia, and worsening irritability. She reports that 11 months ago she was the first responder to a multicar crash involving fatalities, including a child who died despite resuscitation attempts. She recalls seeing the child\u2019s face and hearing the parent screaming. She states, \u201cI can still smell the gasoline and blood like it\u2019s happening again.\u201d\n\nSince the incident, she experiences intrusive, unwanted memories several times per day, often triggered by sirens, the smell of fuel, or seeing children in car seats. She reports recurrent distressing dreams 2\u20133 times per week in which she is \u201cback on the road\u201d and wakes \u201csoaked in sweat\u201d with her heart racing. On two occasions while driving past the crash site, she felt as if the scene was replaying in real time and briefly lost awareness of her surroundings; she describes, \u201cIt was like I was watching myself from outside my body,\u201d followed by intense panic and a need to pull over.\n\nShe actively avoids reminders: she has changed routes to avoid the highway, refuses to watch news stories about accidents, and has asked her supervisor to keep her off pediatric calls. She notes emotional and cognitive changes since the event, including persistent guilt (\u201cI should have done more, I failed that kid\u201d), shame, and a shift in beliefs (\u201cThe world is dangerous; something terrible can happen any second\u201d). She reports diminished interest in socializing with coworkers, feels detached from her spouse (\u201cI\u2019m there but not really there\u201d), and describes a restricted range of positive emotion: \u201cEven when my daughter is laughing, I can\u2019t feel it the way I used to.\u201d\n\nArousal symptoms are prominent. She endorses chronic hypervigilance, sitting with her back to the wall in restaurants and scanning exits. She has an exaggerated startle response to sudden noises and becomes irritable with low frustration tolerance; her spouse reports she \u201csnaps\u201d over minor issues. She has difficulty concentrating at work and at home, often rereading documentation multiple times. Sleep is fragmented with prolonged sleep onset and frequent awakenings; she sleeps 3\u20135 hours/night and reports daytime fatigue.\n\nSymptoms began within weeks after the crash, have persisted for >10 months, and cause clinically significant impairment: she has called out of work multiple times, performance reviews note reduced focus, and her marital relationship is strained. She denies a history of similar symptoms prior to the incident. She denies current or past manic episodes. She reports intermittent passive thoughts such as \u201cI wish I could just not wake up,\u201d particularly after nightmares, but denies active suicidal intent, plan, or preparatory behaviors; protective factors include her daughter and engagement with treatment.\n\nRegarding substances, she reports increased alcohol use since the incident to \u201cshut my brain off,\u201d though she denies morning drinking, withdrawal symptoms, or legal consequences. She denies illicit drug use. She is not taking steroids or stimulants. Neurologic review is negative for seizures or head injury. She reports occasional brief episodes of palpitations and chest tightness when confronted with reminders; these are situational and followed by avoidance. Mental status exam: alert and oriented; affect anxious and constricted; mood \u201con edge\u201d; thought process linear; thought content notable for guilt and threat-based beliefs; no hallucinations or fixed delusions; insight and judgment fair. She becomes visibly tense when recounting the crash and pauses to \u201ccatch my breath.\u201d",

    "clinical_text": "They present to an outpatient psychiatry clinic at the suggestion of their primary care clinician due to chronic social difficulties, escalating workplace stress, and episodes of shutdown-like withdrawal after changes in routine. They report, \u201cI can do my job, but the social part feels like acting all day. When I get home, I\u2019m wiped out and I can\u2019t talk to anyone.\u201d They deny current suicidal intent but endorse intermittent passive thoughts during periods of overwhelm (\u201cI wish I could disappear for a day\u201d) without plan or prior attempts.\n\nHistory indicates longstanding differences in social communication. In childhood, caregivers described them as \u201cbright but in their own world.\u201d They reportedly spoke early with an unusually formal tone and tended to monologue about preferred topics. They had difficulty with back-and-forth conversation, often missing cues that others were bored or wanting to change the subject. They recall being confused by implied meanings and sarcasm: \u201cIf someone says \u2018It\u2019s fine,\u2019 I assume it\u2019s fine unless they literally tell me otherwise.\u201d In sessions, their speech is fluent and detailed but can become overly precise; they sometimes answer questions with extensive contextual information and need gentle redirection. They report needing to rehearse conversations and keep a mental script, especially for phone calls: \u201cI write down what I\u2019ll say. If the other person goes off-script, my brain stalls.\u201d\n\nThey describe persistent difficulty developing and maintaining relationships. They have a strong desire for connection but find most socializing exhausting and unpredictable. They report having been bullied in middle school for being \u201cweird\u201d and \u201ctoo intense.\u201d They have had one brief romantic relationship that ended due to communication misunderstandings; they describe not noticing the partner\u2019s growing dissatisfaction until it was explicitly stated. They prefer solitary activities, maintain an online friendship centered around shared interests, and rarely attend group events. They state, \u201cI don\u2019t know what people want from small talk. It feels pointless, but I know it\u2019s expected.\u201d\n\nNonverbal communication differences are noted and reported. During the interview, eye contact is intermittent and appears effortful; they look away when thinking and report eye contact can feel \u201clike staring into a light.\u201d Their facial expression is somewhat limited in range, and prosody is occasionally monotone. They describe difficulty interpreting others\u2019 facial expressions unless they are overt: \u201cI can tell if someone is angry, but subtle stuff\u2014no.\u201d They report being told they come across as blunt or disinterested even when they are engaged.\n\nRestricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests are prominent. They describe deep, circumscribed interests since early childhood (e.g., transit maps, then computer hardware, currently niche data-logging tools and a specific strategy game). They can spend hours researching and organizing information and experience distress if interrupted: \u201cIf I\u2019m in the middle of a system, stopping feels physically uncomfortable.\u201d They keep extensive lists and spreadsheets for daily tasks and food intake and feel calmer when information is categorized.\n\nThey endorse a strong preference for sameness and routine. A recent office reorganization (new seating plan, different daily stand-up format, and increased open-office noise) triggered marked anxiety, reduced appetite, and two episodes where they became unable to speak for several hours after work. They describe these episodes as \u201cmy brain goes offline; I can\u2019t find words, and I just lie in the dark.\u201d They also report distress when plans change at the last minute and rely on predictable meal choices and commute routes.\n\nSensory differences are significant. They are highly sensitive to certain sounds (keyboard clacking, fluorescent light buzz), particular clothing textures, and strong smells. They wear noise-canceling headphones most of the day and avoid crowded grocery stores. They describe \u201csensory overload\u201d leading to irritability and shutdown. They also seek sensory comfort through repetitive movements; during the interview, they intermittently rub their fingertips together and rock subtly when discussing stressful topics, which they report helps them self-regulate: \u201cIt stops the static feeling.\u201d\n\nFunctionally, they are technically strong at work and receive positive feedback on accuracy, but interpersonal demands are impairing. They struggle with ambiguous instructions, office politics, and group brainstorming. They report miscommunications with coworkers, difficulty knowing when to join conversations, and anxiety about being perceived as rude. They have requested remote work as an accommodation due to noise and interruptions.\n\nComorbid symptoms include chronic generalized worry, muscle tension, and sleep-onset insomnia that worsened with workplace changes. They report frequent rumination (\u201cI replay conversations for hours to figure out what I did wrong\u201d) and occasional panic-like surges in overstimulating environments, though they do not avoid leaving home entirely. They also endorse lifelong attentional variability: strong focus on preferred tasks but difficulty initiating boring tasks, losing track of time, and forgetting non-preferred chores; however, their academic record was strong with structured deadlines. Mood symptoms include episodic low mood and fatigue during periods of prolonged social masking and sensory stress, but they deny sustained anhedonia or pervasive hopelessness outside of these contexts.\n\nDevelopmental history (per patient report and a brief collateral call with a parent) supports early onset. As a toddler/young child, they preferred lining up objects, became upset if items were moved, and showed intense interest in specific topics. They had few peer friendships, often played alone, and were described as \u201cliteral\u201d and \u201crule-bound.\u201d No history suggests global developmental delay or intellectual disability; they met academic milestones and have above-average verbal and analytical abilities. There is no history of psychosis, mania, or substance use disorder. Medical history is notable only for migraines; they take no psychotropic medications currently.\n\nMental status examination: appearance neat and casual; behavior cooperative but somewhat guarded initially; psychomotor mildly restless with subtle rocking; speech normal rate, occasionally overly detailed; mood \u201cstressed\u201d; affect constricted but congruent; thought process logical and goal-directed; thought content notable for worry and social self-criticism; no delusions or hallucinations; cognition grossly intact; insight fair; judgment intact. Overall presentation reflects a longstanding pattern of social-communication differences and restricted/repetitive behaviors with sensory sensitivities, present since early development and causing clinically significant impairment, particularly in social and occupational functioning, with concurrent anxiety and stress-related shutdown episodes.",

My family would be better off if I wasn\u2019t dragging everyone down.\u201d She reports guilt that feels excessive and disproportionate (\u201cI can\u2019t stop replaying every small mistake at work like it proves I\u2019m incompetent\u201d). She acknowledges intermittent passive thoughts of death over the past two weeks (\u201csometimes I think it would be easier not to wake up\u201d), but denies a plan, intent, rehearsal behaviors, or access to firearms. Protective factors include her child and spouse; she states, \u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything to myself\u2014I just want the pain to stop.\u201d\n\nAnxiety symptoms are present but appear temporally linked to the mood decline. Over the last 1\u20132 months, she has been more keyed up and tense at work, worrying about making a harmful mistake and being judged by colleagues. She notes muscle tension in her shoulders and occasional stomach \u201cknots\u201d before shifts. However, she does not describe a long-standing pattern of worry across multiple life areas, and she reports the worry is largely confined to work performance and is not present on days off. She can sometimes redirect her worry with reassurance or task checklists and does not describe it as uncontrollable. She denies frequent panic attacks, compulsions, traumatic re-experiencing, or avoidance behaviors beyond reduced social engagement related to low motivation.\n\nShe denies any history of periods of abnormally elevated mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, grandiosity, pressured speech, risky behaviors, or marked increases in goal-directed activity. She denies hallucinations or delusional beliefs. She has no current grief trigger; stressors include recent staffing shortages and rotating shifts. No recent medication changes. She denies stimulant, cannabis, or illicit substance use.\n\nFunctional impact is significant: increased absenteeism, withdrawing from friends, decreased parenting engagement (\u201cI\u2019m physically there but emotionally absent\u201d), and reduced self-care. She is seeking help because \u201cthis isn\u2019t me, and it\u2019s not getting better.\u201d",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. L is a 34-year-old project coordinator who presents for evaluation due to \u201cconstant worrying that I can\u2019t shut off,\u201d worsening over the past year. She reports feeling anxious and keyed up on most days for at least 8\u201310 months, with worries spanning multiple areas: work performance (\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll miss something and get fired\u201d), finances (\u201cWhat if we can\u2019t cover an emergency?\u201d), her child\u2019s safety/health (\u201cIf he coughs I spiral into thinking it\u2019s something serious\u201d), and her own health (\u201cI keep thinking something\u2019s wrong with me even when tests are fine\u201d). She notes that the worries feel excessive relative to the situation and that reassurance provides only brief relief. She describes difficulty controlling the worry: \u201cI tell myself to stop, but it keeps running like a radio in the background.\u201d\n\nShe endorses associated physical and cognitive symptoms occurring on most days: restlessness (\u201cI\u2019m on edge, like I can\u2019t fully relax\u201d), easy fatigability (\u201cBy late afternoon I\u2019m wiped out but still tense\u201d), difficulty concentrating (\u201cI read the same email three times and still feel unsure\u201d), irritability (\u201cLittle things set me off, then I feel guilty\u201d), muscle tension (tight shoulders/jaw with frequent tension headaches), and sleep disturbance (takes 60\u201390 minutes to fall asleep due to rumination; wakes at 3\u20134 a.m. thinking about tasks; averages ~5\u20136 hours/night). She reports functional impact: she spends significant time checking calendars, rereading messages, and seeking reassurance from her spouse; she avoids delegating at work and stays late to \u201cmake sure nothing goes wrong,\u201d leading to burnout and increased conflict at home.\n\nNon-standard features include intermittent gastrointestinal distress during periods of heightened stress (abdominal cramping and loose stools before meetings), which her primary care clinician previously characterized as stress-related; she also reports occasional brief surges of intense anxiety with palpitations and shortness of breath when she receives unexpected work calls, typically lasting 5\u201310 minutes, but she does not fear having another attack or change behavior specifically to avoid future episodes. She denies persistent avoidance of public places, and she continues to attend work and errands.\n\nMood symptoms are present but do not dominate the clinical picture. She describes feeling \u201cdrained and discouraged\u201d at times and less enjoyment in hobbies due to preoccupation with worry, but she denies sustained low mood most of the day nearly every day for weeks at a time. Appetite is largely unchanged. She denies suicidal ideation, intent, or past attempts. There is no history suggestive of manic or hypomanic episodes (no periods of decreased need for sleep with increased energy, grandiosity, or risky behavior).\n\nShe denies obsessions with ritualized compulsions (no repetitive checking driven by intrusive taboo thoughts; her checking is described as attempts to reduce generalized doubt and prevent mistakes), denies trauma-related re-experiencing or hypervigilance tied to a specific traumatic event, and denies social fear focused on scrutiny or humiliation as the primary driver (she worries broadly, including when alone). She does not report hallucinations or delusional beliefs.\n\nMedical history is notable for episodic tension headaches and the above GI complaints; no known thyroid disease. Current medications: occasional ibuprofen. She denies stimulant use and reports stable caffeine intake. Recent basic labs through her primary care clinician (including thyroid screening) were reportedly normal. Family history includes a mother described as a \u201cchronic worrier\u201d and a father with alcohol use problems in remission. Psychosocial stressors include increased workload after a team reorganization and childcare disruptions.\n\nMental status exam: well-groomed, cooperative, mildly fidgety. Speech normal rate and tone. Mood \u201canxious,\u201d affect tense but reactive. Thought process linear; thought content notable for excessive worry and catastrophizing; no suicidal or homicidal ideation. Cognition grossly intact, though attention is mildly impaired by anxiety. Insight and judgment fair. She is motivated for treatment, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in my head like this.\u201d",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \u201cMy brain is like a browser with 40 tabs open\u2014some are playing music and I can\u2019t find which one.\u201d\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient presents for evaluation of longstanding problems with focus, organization, and follow-through that have become more impairing after a recent promotion requiring more independent project management. She reports frequent careless mistakes in design specs and email communication (\u201cI\u2019ll send the wrong file or miss a key requirement even when I know it\u201d), difficulty sustaining attention during meetings unless she is actively speaking, and a tendency to drift mentally during routine tasks (\u201cIf it\u2019s not urgent or interesting, it\u2019s like my mind slides away\u201d). She describes starting multiple tasks, then abandoning them when interrupted: \u201cI open a doc, then remember an email, then I\u2019m reorganizing my desktop. Two hours later I\u2019ve done nothing.\u201d She often misplaces her badge, keys, and earbuds, and relies heavily on phone reminders and notes that she still forgets to check. She reports procrastination on administrative tasks (expense reports, scheduling) despite awareness of consequences, followed by last-minute \u201cpanic productivity.\u201d\n\nHyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms are described as internal restlessness and difficulty waiting or pacing her output rather than overt motor hyperactivity: \u201cI feel revved up inside. I\u2019m not bouncing off the walls, but I\u2019m constantly fidgeting.\u201d She taps her foot, picks at cuticles, and shifts positions frequently. She interrupts colleagues when excited about an idea and finishes others\u2019 sentences, later feeling embarrassed: \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude\u2014my mouth moves before my brain checks in.\u201d She reports speaking quickly when passionate and occasionally making impulsive online purchases, then regretting them. She experiences impatience in slow-moving situations (lines, long meetings) and tends to switch between tasks for stimulation.\n\nDevelopmental and educational history: She recalls these issues dating back to childhood. In elementary school, teachers noted she was \u201cbright but daydreamy,\u201d frequently forgot homework, and talked excessively with peers. Report cards reportedly included comments such as \u201cneeds to pay attention,\u201d \u201crushes through work,\u201d and \u201ccould do better with organization.\u201d She did well in classes she enjoyed but struggled to complete long-term projects without parental scaffolding. Symptoms were present at home and school, with frequent conflicts around chores and morning routines (\u201cI\u2019d get distracted and end up reading or drawing instead of getting dressed\u201d). No history of language delay, no special education placement, and no reported loss of skills.\n\nSocial and interpersonal functioning / ASD overlap considerations: She describes feeling socially drained after heavy interaction days and prefers some downtime, which she attributes to being \u201coverstimulated.\u201d She worries she can come across as \u201cawkward\u201d at times because she misses parts of conversations when her attention drifts. However, she reports longstanding interest in friendships, dating, and understanding social dynamics. She maintains a close group of friends, describes reciprocal relationships, and demonstrates appropriate use of eye contact and gestures in session. She endorses understanding sarcasm and implied meaning (\u201cI\u2019m usually the one making the joke\u201d). She can describe others\u2019 perspectives and emotions, though she sometimes fails to track details when distracted. She denies a lifelong pattern of difficulty with back-and-forth conversation due to not understanding social rules; rather, she attributes missteps to inattention and impulsive interjections.\n\nShe reports sensory sensitivities that raise diagnostic questions: she is easily distracted by background noise (keyboard clacking, fluorescent hum) and becomes irritable in crowded, noisy environments. She also dislikes certain clothing textures. She notes these sensitivities worsen when tired or stressed and improve with noise-canceling headphones. She does not report stereotyped movements, insistence on sameness, or distress with minor routine changes beyond becoming disorganized. She denies circumscribed, all-consuming interests; she has strong hobbies (illustration, games, hiking) that shift over time. She describes flexibility with plans when organized, but acknowledges that unexpected changes can be overwhelming mainly because they \u201cblow up my schedule and I can\u2019t re-prioritize.\u201d\n\nFunctional impairment: At work, she has received feedback about missed details, inconsistent follow-through, and late deliverables, despite strong creative output and problem-solving when engaged. She reports spending excessive time compensating (working late, rewriting notes, rechecking work), leading to burnout. At home, clutter accumulates, bills are sometimes paid late, and she struggles with meal planning and keeping track of appointments. She reports near-misses while driving due to distraction (e.g., missing an exit), but no major accidents.\n\nMood, anxiety, and differential: She reports episodic stress and self-criticism related to underperformance (\u201cI feel like I\u2019m failing at adulting\u201d), with occasional sleep-onset difficulty when she has deadlines. She denies persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, suicidal ideation, or history consistent with mania/hypomania. She reports situational anxiety about work performance but does not describe pervasive generalized worry across domains. No history of trauma-related symptoms. She denies hallucinations or delusions.\n\nSubstance use and medical: She drinks alcohol socially (1\u20133 drinks/week), denies cannabis or stimulant misuse. No history of thyroid disease, seizures, or head injury. Caffeine intake is 2\u20133 coffees/day; she reports it sometimes \u201ccalms me down enough to start.\u201d\n\nFamily history: Father described as \u201crestless and forgetful,\u201d with chronic disorganization; no formal diagnoses reported. Maternal history of anxiety.\n\nMental status exam (during interview): Well-groomed, cooperative. Speech fluent, occasionally rapid when discussing ideas. Mood \u201cstressed,\u201d affect congruent and reactive. Thought process generally linear but tangential at times with quick topic shifts; easily redirected. No psychosis. Cognition grossly intact; attention fluctuates (asks for questions to be repeated once, checks phone calendar mid-interview). Insight and judgment fair.\n\nSummary formulation: The presentation involves chronic, childhood-onset difficulties with sustained attention, organization, and impulsive responding across school, home, and work, producing clinically significant impairment. Social concerns and sensory sensitivities create an overlapping picture, but the history shows intact social reciprocity, pragmatic understanding, and flexibility without a consistent developmental pattern of core social-communication deficits or restricted/repetitive behaviors.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. A is a 32-year-old paramedic who presents for evaluation due to persistent anxiety, sleep disruption, and worsening work and relationship functioning since a traumatic call 4 months ago. She reports responding to a multi-vehicle highway collision in which she attempted prolonged resuscitation of a 9-year-old child who died at the scene. She describes witnessing severe injuries and significant blood exposure, and states she feared she would be hit by oncoming traffic during the rescue. She reports that since the incident she has had recurrent, involuntary memories of the scene \u201cpopping into my head like I\u2019m right back there,\u201d occurring daily, especially when she hears sirens or sees child car seats. She endorses nightmares 3\u20134 nights per week with content related to the crash and wakes in a panic, soaked in sweat.\n\nShe describes episodes at work where she briefly feels as if the crash is happening again, stating, \u201cFor a few seconds I can smell the gasoline and I\u2019m back on the pavement.\u201d During these episodes she becomes visibly distressed, her heart races, and she feels shaky. She reports marked distress when exposed to reminders (e.g., driving near the highway where it happened, seeing ambulances, hearing screeching brakes) and notes physiologic reactivity including palpitations, chest tightness, and nausea.\n\nShe reports active avoidance: she refuses to drive on the stretch of highway where the collision occurred, takes longer alternate routes, and has swapped away from pediatric calls when possible. She avoids talking about the event with colleagues and family, stating, \u201cIf I start thinking about it, I can\u2019t shut it off,\u201d and she changes the subject when others bring up recent accidents on the news.\n\nShe endorses persistent negative changes in mood and thinking since the event. She reports feeling ongoing guilt and self-blame (\u201cI should have done more; I keep thinking I missed something\u201d), despite acknowledging intellectually that the injuries were likely unsurvivable. She describes a persistently negative emotional state (fear, sadness, anger) and diminished interest in previously enjoyed activities (stopped running with friends, no longer attends family gatherings). She feels detached from others, stating, \u201cI\u2019m there but not really there,\u201d and notes difficulty experiencing positive emotions: \u201cEven when something good happens, I feel numb.\u201d She denies persistent inability to remember the key aspects of the event; she recalls the sequence clearly.\n\nShe also reports heightened arousal and reactivity: she is hypervigilant in public places and while driving, frequently scanning mirrors and exits. She has an exaggerated startle response to loud noises and sudden movements, stating she \u201cjumps out of my skin\u201d when doors slam. She reports irritability and angry outbursts, snapping at coworkers and family \u201cover nothing.\u201d Concentration has worsened; she rereads patient care reports repeatedly and worries about making mistakes. Sleep is poor due to nightmares and difficulty falling and staying asleep.\n\nSymptoms have been present nearly every day for the past 4 months and began within weeks of the crash. She reports clinically significant impairment: she has used increased sick leave, requested fewer shifts, and is considering leaving field work. She reports strain in relationships due to emotional withdrawal and irritability. She denies current or past manic/hypomanic episodes, psychotic symptoms, or obsessive-compulsive rituals. She denies current suicidal intent or plan; she reports occasional passive thoughts such as \u201cI wish I could just not wake up\u201d after nightmares but states she would not act on these thoughts and identifies protective factors (family, career goals). She denies heavy alcohol use and denies substance use. Medical review is unremarkable; she is not taking steroids or stimulants. Presentation is most consistent with a trauma- and stress-related syndrome following exposure to actual death and threatened serious injury, with intrusive symptoms, avoidance, negative mood/cognition changes, and hyperarousal lasting longer than one month with significant functional impairment.",

    "clinical_text": "Mr. R is a 24-year-old man referred by his university counseling center for longstanding difficulties with social interaction and increasing distress when routines change. He reports that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what to do in conversations unless there\u2019s a clear topic,\u201d and that social situations feel like \u201ca rulebook everyone else got but me.\u201d\n\nHistory and current presentation:\n- Social communication/interaction: During the interview he makes limited, fleeting eye contact, speaks in a formal, somewhat monotone voice, and often gives lengthy, detail-heavy answers without noticing the clinician\u2019s attempts to redirect. He struggles with back-and-forth conversation; when asked how his week was, he responds by listing specific activities with timestamps and does not spontaneously ask reciprocal questions. He describes difficulty understanding implied meaning, sarcasm, and indirect requests: \u201cIf someone says, \u2018It\u2019s cold in here,\u2019 I\u2019m not sure if they want me to close the window or if they\u2019re just stating a fact.\u201d He reports frequently missing social cues (e.g., not noticing when peers are bored or when it is his turn to speak). He also notes trouble interpreting facial expressions and tone of voice: \u201cI can tell if someone is yelling, but the in-between emotions are hard.\u201d\n- Relationships: He has always had few friends and tends to prefer solitary activities. He reports wanting companionship but not knowing how to initiate or maintain friendships: \u201cI don\u2019t know when it\u2019s okay to text again, so I just don\u2019t.\u201d He avoids group projects unless roles are explicitly assigned. He has never been in a romantic relationship and describes feeling confused by dating norms and nonverbal flirting. He reports frequent misunderstandings at work, such as coworkers thinking he is \u201crude\u201d when he is trying to be precise.\n\nRestricted/repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities:\n- Insistence on sameness/routines: He becomes significantly distressed when plans change. He describes taking the same route to campus daily and feeling \u201cpanicky and stuck\u201d if a bus is late or diverted. He eats the same breakfast and becomes upset if the usual brand is unavailable: \u201cMy whole morning feels wrong and I can\u2019t focus.\u201d\n- Highly restricted, fixated interests: Since adolescence he has had an intense interest in train timetables and transit systems. He can recite detailed schedules and historical changes and spends several hours nightly reading about signaling systems. He acknowledges that he often talks at length about this topic even when others are not interested: \u201cI don\u2019t notice until they leave or change the subject.\u201d\n- Repetitive behaviors/speech: He demonstrates occasional hand-fidgeting and subtle finger tapping when anxious. He reports repeating certain phrases under his breath when stressed to \u201creset my brain.\u201d He has a history of scripting lines from documentaries as a child, especially in new situations.\n- Sensory sensitivities: He describes strong discomfort with specific sounds and textures. He wears noise-canceling headphones in the cafeteria because \u201cthe clanging and chatter feels physically painful.\u201d He avoids certain clothing fabrics and reports being overwhelmed by fluorescent lighting in some classrooms.\n\nDevelopmental history:\nHis mother, reached by collateral call with his consent, reports that these patterns were present in early childhood. He spoke his first words on time but used unusually formal language and tended to monologue about preferred topics. In preschool he played beside rather than with other children, became upset when classroom routines changed, and had intense interests (e.g., memorizing bus numbers). Teachers noted limited pretend play, difficulty with cooperative play, and trouble understanding peer social rules. There is no history of psychotic symptoms. He denies periods of elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, or impulsive risk-taking. He reports occasional anxiety, mainly triggered by social demands and unexpected changes.\n\nFunctioning and impairment:\nHe is academically strong in structured, rule-based coursework but struggles in classes requiring open-ended discussion or group collaboration. At work he completes repetitive tasks accurately but has received feedback about \"tone\" and difficulty adapting to last-minute changes. He reports fatigue after social interactions and spends significant time recovering alone. These difficulties have caused persistent functional impairment in education, employment, and social life.\n\nMental status (salient points):\nAlert and oriented; grooming appropriate. Speech fluent but pedantic and somewhat monotone. Affect constricted; mood \"stressed.\" Thought process linear but overly detailed. No delusions or hallucinations. Insight partial (recognizes differences but attributes them to \u201cbeing logical\u201d). Judgment intact for basic safety. No suicidal or homicidal ideation.\n\nOverall, his presentation reflects lifelong difficulties in social reciprocity and nonverbal communication, limited ability to develop age-appropriate relationships, alongside marked rigidity, circumscribed interests, repetitive behaviors, and sensory sensitivities beginning in early development and causing clinically significant impairment across settings.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. A is a 34-year-old elementary school teacher who presents to outpatient psychiatry for evaluation of a 6-week period of persistent low mood and loss of interest. She reports feeling \"down and empty almost all day, every day\" and says, \"Nothing feels enjoyable\u2014not even reading to my kids or watching my favorite shows.\" Symptoms began gradually after no clear trigger and have been continuous.\n\nShe endorses markedly reduced interest in previously pleasurable activities (stopped exercising and socializing, stopped volunteering at school events). She reports low energy and fatigue, stating, \"I feel exhausted even after doing nothing.\" Sleep is disrupted with early-morning awakening: she falls asleep around 11 pm but wakes at 3\u20134 am and cannot return to sleep, leaving her feeling unrefreshed. Appetite is decreased with unintentional weight loss of approximately 8 pounds over the past month. She describes slowed functioning, stating she is \"moving through mud\" and coworkers have commented she seems unusually quiet and slowed in the classroom.\n\nShe reports impaired concentration and indecisiveness: she rereads emails multiple times and struggles to plan lessons, leading to missed deadlines and increased errors at work. She describes excessive guilt and feelings of worthlessness: \"My family would be better off without me. I\u2019m failing as a mom and a teacher.\" She denies hallucinations or delusional beliefs.\n\nRegarding safety, she endorses recurrent thoughts of death over the past two weeks and passive suicidal ideation (\"Sometimes I wish I wouldn\u2019t wake up\"), and on two occasions has thought about \"taking a bunch of pills\" but denies any current intent. She denies having gathered medications, written a note, or taken preparatory actions. Protective factors include her children and willingness to seek help; she agrees to contact supports and emergency services if thoughts worsen.\n\nShe reports significant functional impairment: she has taken three sick days in the last two weeks, is falling behind on grading, and has withdrawn from family activities. There is no history of similar prolonged episodes in the past. She denies any past periods of abnormally elevated or irritable mood, decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, impulsive spending, or other symptoms suggestive of manic or hypomanic episodes. She denies panic attacks, trauma-related flashbacks, or obsessive-compulsive symptoms. She denies current or recent substance use beyond rare alcohol; no stimulant, opioid, or cannabis use.\n\nPast psychiatric history is negative for hospitalizations. She has never taken psychiatric medication and has not engaged in formal psychotherapy. Family history is notable for a mother with longstanding depression treated with medication. Review of systems is negative for symptoms suggesting thyroid disease or other acute medical causes. Mental status exam shows a tearful woman with constricted affect, depressed mood, slowed speech, and reduced psychomotor activity; thought process is linear; cognition grossly intact though attention is reduced; insight and judgment are fair. Overall presentation is consistent with a sustained depressive syndrome lasting more than two weeks, causing clinically significant distress and impairment, without evidence of substance-induced or medical etiology, and without a history of manic/hypomanic episodes.",

    "clinical_text": "A 34-year-old elementary school teacher presents to outpatient psychiatry reporting persistent, difficult-to-control worry occurring most days for the past 9\u201310 months. She describes feeling \"on edge all the time\" and states that her worry shifts across multiple areas, including work performance (lesson planning, classroom management, evaluations), her child\u2019s health and safety, finances, and concerns about her parents aging. She notes that even when one issue is resolved, \"my mind immediately finds something else to worry about.\" She reports she cannot easily stop or control the worrying, saying, \"I tell myself to let it go, but it just keeps looping.\" \n\nShe endorses associated symptoms including restlessness and feeling keyed up (frequently fidgeting, difficulty relaxing after work), fatigue (\"I\u2019m exhausted by the afternoon, like I\u2019ve been running a marathon in my head\"), difficulty concentrating (loses track while grading and rereads emails repeatedly), irritability (snapping at her spouse and feeling \"short\" with her child, which is not typical for her), muscle tension (tight shoulders and jaw clenching; occasional tension headaches), and sleep disturbance (trouble falling asleep due to worry and waking early with racing thoughts). She denies discrete surges of intense fear, palpitations, or episodes that peak within minutes; instead she describes a chronic, steady level of anxiety. \n\nThe anxiety and related symptoms have led to clinically significant distress and impairment: she spends excessive time double-checking work tasks, seeks repeated reassurance from her spouse, and has reduced social activities because she feels too tense and tired. She reports decreased efficiency at work and has received feedback that she appears distracted. \n\nShe denies current or past manic or hypomanic episodes (no periods of abnormally elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, or increased goal-directed activity). She denies persistent low mood or loss of interest most days; she describes her mood as \"mostly anxious\" and states she can still enjoy activities when she is able to engage in them. She denies intrusive unwanted thoughts with compulsive rituals, trauma-related re-experiencing symptoms, or marked fear limited to social scrutiny or specific situations; the worry is generalized and spans multiple domains. She denies suicidal or homicidal ideation. \n\nMedical review is unremarkable; she reports no weight loss, heat intolerance, tremor, or other symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism. She is not taking steroids, stimulants, or other medications associated with anxiety and denies illicit drug use. Alcohol use is minimal and not temporally related to symptoms. Family history is notable for a mother described as a \"chronic worrier.\" Mental status examination shows an appropriately dressed woman who is cooperative and tearful at times; psychomotor activity mildly increased with fidgeting; speech normal rate and volume; mood \"anxious\" with congruent affect; thought process linear; thought content notable for excessive worry and catastrophizing; no delusions or hallucinations; cognition grossly intact though she reports concentration difficulties; insight and judgment are fair. Overall presentation is consistent with persistent, excessive, difficult-to-control worry with multiple associated physical and cognitive symptoms over more than six months, causing functional impairment and not attributable to substances, a medical condition, or another primary mental disorder.",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \u201cI can\u2019t keep my life together unless everything is on fire.\u201d\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient presents for evaluation due to longstanding difficulties with focus, follow-through, and organization that have become more impairing after a recent promotion to a role requiring more independent project management. She reports frequent \u201ccareless\u201d mistakes in code reviews, missed small requirements, and difficulty tracking multiple tasks unless she uses elaborate reminders. She describes starting tasks with good intentions but quickly drifting to unrelated tabs or messages: \u201cI\u2019ll open the ticket and then somehow I\u2019m reorganizing my inbox or reading random articles.\u201d She endorses difficulty sustaining attention during meetings, especially when discussions are lengthy or not immediately relevant, and admits she often realizes she has \u201cno idea what was decided\u201d and has to ask colleagues to repeat decisions.\n\nShe reports chronic disorganization: cluttered workspace, difficulty planning steps, and underestimating how long tasks will take. She frequently misplaces items (badge, earbuds, keys) and describes \u201cpanic searching\u201d most mornings. She forgets appointments unless she sets multiple alarms and has missed two recent medical visits. At home, her partner complains she doesn\u2019t follow through on chores and \u201chalf-starts\u201d projects (laundry left mid-cycle, groceries not put away). She endorses avoiding tasks that require sustained mental effort (expense reports, long documentation), describing a strong urge to delay until deadlines are imminent: \u201cIf it\u2019s not due today, my brain won\u2019t touch it.\u201d\n\nShe also notes a mild motor restlessness that is more noticeable in quiet settings: tapping her foot, picking at nails, and getting up during movies. She denies needing to run around but says she feels \u201cinternally revved\u201d when she tries to sit still for long periods. At work she sometimes interrupts or finishes others\u2019 sentences when excited, then regrets it. She does not describe impulsive spending, reckless driving, or legal problems.\n\nCourse and onset: She recalls similar patterns since childhood. In elementary school she was frequently told she was \u201csmart but not turning things in,\u201d lost homework, and had a chronically messy desk. She reports her parents had to check her backpack nightly to prevent missed assignments. She describes doing well on tests but inconsistent grades due to incomplete work. In college she relied heavily on last-minute \u201call-nighters,\u201d studying only when urgency was high. Symptoms have been present across multiple settings (school/work and home) and have caused functional impairment, with a recent written warning at work for missed deadlines and incomplete documentation. She reports that the difficulties are not limited to periods of stress, though stress worsens them.\n\nMood/anxiety/sleep: She reports increased worry over the past year related to performance and fear of losing her job (\u201cI\u2019m always waiting to be found out\u201d), with muscle tension and difficulty falling asleep. Sleep averages 5\u20136 hours on weekdays due to late-night \u201ccatch-up\u201d work and difficulty disengaging from screens; she feels tired in the mornings. She endorses occasional low mood and guilt (\u201cI feel lazy\u201d), but denies persistent anhedonia, appetite change, or suicidal thoughts. No history suggestive of manic or hypomanic episodes (denies decreased need for sleep with elevated mood, grandiosity, or risky behaviors).\n\nSubstance/medical: Drinks 3\u20135 cups of coffee/day \u201cto get going.\u201d Alcohol 1\u20132 drinks on weekends; cannabis edible about twice monthly. Denies other substance use. No history of head injury, seizures, thyroid disease, or significant medical illness. No current medications.\n\nFamily/developmental: Father described as \u201cconstantly losing things and late\u201d though never evaluated. No family history of bipolar disorder or psychotic disorders reported.\n\nMental status exam (abbreviated): Well-groomed, cooperative. Mild fidgeting observed. Speech normal rate/volume. Mood \u201cstressed,\u201d affect mildly anxious but reactive. Thought process linear; no delusions or hallucinations. Cognition grossly intact; attention mildly variable during interview (requests repetition once). Insight and judgment fair.\n\nAssessment summary: Longstanding pattern since childhood of distractibility, difficulty sustaining attention, disorganization, forgetfulness, and incomplete follow-through with clear impairment in occupational and home functioning. Mild comorbid anxiety and insomnia appear secondary/maintained by chronic performance difficulties and compensatory overwork. No evidence that symptoms are better explained by a primary mood disorder, psychotic disorder, or substance intoxication/withdrawal.",

    "clinical_text": "A 34-year-old EMT presents to outpatient psychiatry reporting worsening sleep, irritability, and distressing memories since a workplace incident 10 months ago. She describes responding to a multi-vehicle collision in which she attempted prolonged extrication and resuscitation of a critically injured adolescent who died at the scene. She states, \"I can still feel the blood on my gloves and hear the mother screaming.\" She reports that during the incident she believed she might be struck by passing traffic and \"thought I was going to die out there.\" She returned to work after taking two weeks off, but over the past several months her symptoms have persisted and intensified.\n\nShe endorses recurrent, involuntary, intrusive memories of the scene occurring daily, often triggered by sirens, the smell of gasoline, or seeing a similar model of car. She reports nightmares 3\u20134 nights per week with themes of being trapped in a vehicle or failing to save someone; she wakes \"soaked in sweat\" and has difficulty returning to sleep. She describes episodes at work where \"it\u2019s like I\u2019m back there\" when hearing a certain radio tone, with brief moments of feeling detached from her surroundings; she clarifies these episodes last seconds to a couple of minutes and are followed by shakiness and nausea. She avoids driving on highways and has taken longer surface routes to work; she also avoids watching news about accidents and refuses certain dispatch calls if she can swap assignments. She states, \"I don\u2019t even want to talk about that night\u2014if I start, I can\u2019t stop shaking.\" She reports pulling away from coworkers and friends, turning down social invitations, and spending most off-days at home.\n\nShe describes persistent negative mood and thinking changes since the incident: ongoing guilt and self-blame (\"If I\u2019d cut the door faster, he\u2019d be alive\"), diminished interest in activities she previously enjoyed (running and meeting friends), and a sense of estrangement (\"I\u2019m not like other people anymore\u2014no one gets it\"). She reports difficulty experiencing positive emotions: \"Even when something good happens, it doesn\u2019t land.\" She denies persistent inability to recall key aspects of the event; she can recount the timeline but avoids details.\n\nShe endorses hyperarousal symptoms: marked irritability and frequent verbal outbursts at work, exaggerated startle to sudden noises, constant scanning of intersections while driving, and difficulty concentrating during charting. She reports sleeping 3\u20135 hours per night with frequent awakenings and remains \"on edge\" most days. She denies physical fights or reckless driving but notes she has become \"too jumpy\" to ride as a passenger. She reports intermittent panic-like surges (racing heart, shortness of breath, trembling) when confronted with reminders such as a similar accident scene; she attributes these episodes to \"my body thinking it\u2019s happening again.\" She denies current suicidal intent or plan; she endorses fleeting passive thoughts after difficult shifts (\"Sometimes I think, what\u2019s the point\") but states she would not act because of responsibility to her family and colleagues. No history of suicide attempts.\n\nFunctionally, she reports significant impairment: increased sick days, difficulty staying on calls, and a written warning for being short-tempered with a coworker. She is considering leaving the field despite previously feeling committed to the job. She reports her alcohol intake has increased on some nights to help with sleep, though she denies morning drinking, withdrawal symptoms, or occupational intoxication. She denies manic symptoms, psychotic symptoms, or obsessive-compulsive rituals. She denies head injury from the event. Medical review is notable for tension headaches and episodic migraines that she feels have worsened with poor sleep.\n\nOn mental status exam, she is alert and oriented, with constricted affect and anxious mood. Speech is normal rate/volume; thought process is linear. Thought content notable for guilt and fear related to the event; no delusions. She becomes visibly tearful and tremulous when describing the crash and requests to pause. Insight and judgment are fair. She denies current intent to harm herself or others.\n\nSymptoms have been present for approximately 10 months, occurring most days, and cause clinically significant distress and impairment. She reports no prior history of similar symptoms before the incident. She is not taking new medications and denies substance use other than alcohol as described; there is no evidence that symptoms are attributable to intoxication, withdrawal, or another medical condition.",

    "clinical_text": "Reason for visit: Parents request evaluation due to long-standing social and behavioral concerns that are more impairing as peer interactions become more complex.\n\nHistory of present concerns: The patient is described as bright academically (especially math and factual learning) but \"doesn't know how to be with other kids.\" At school he tends to play alone, paces at the edge of groups, and will approach peers primarily to deliver facts about his preferred topic. He rarely initiates conversation for social sharing and has difficulty with back-and-forth interaction. His mother reports, \"He can talk at you for 20 minutes about subway maps, but if you ask him how his day was, he just shrugs or repeats what you said.\" When classmates try to change the topic, he often continues his monologue, does not notice boredom, and may walk away abruptly.\n\nSocial communication/interaction: Parents and teacher report limited social-emotional reciprocity. He does not spontaneously share interests or accomplishments (e.g., will not bring drawings to show others) and rarely seeks comfort when upset, instead retreating to his room and rocking. Eye contact is inconsistent; during the interview he frequently looks past the examiner or at the ceiling while speaking. Facial expressions are reduced and sometimes do not match the content (smiling while describing a peer conflict). He has difficulty understanding sarcasm and figurative language; when his teacher said, \"Hold your horses,\" he became distressed and asked where the horses were. He takes rules literally and becomes argumentative when peers bend game rules. He struggles to develop and maintain peer relationships: he wants friends but approaches in rigid, one-sided ways, and he does not readily engage in imaginative cooperative play. Parents report he prefers interacting with adults because \"adults will listen to his facts.\" He has difficulty recognizing others' perspectives; for example, when a classmate cried after being teased, he told them, \"Crying is illogical; it doesn't fix it,\" and appeared confused about why the peer was upset.\n\nRestricted/repetitive behaviors and interests: Since preschool, he has engaged in repetitive motor behaviors, including hand flapping when excited and rocking while seated. Parents describe that as a toddler he would line up toy cars in exact color order and became very upset if the line was disturbed. He currently shows strong insistence on sameness: he requires the same morning routine (same breakfast bowl, same seat in the car) and becomes distressed with unexpected changes (e.g., substitute teacher, altered route to school). When routines change, he may yell, cover his ears, and repeat phrases such as \"No change, no change\" until the situation is corrected.\n\nHe has an unusually intense, circumscribed interest in subway systems and transit maps. He spends hours memorizing station names and designing route diagrams, and he will repeatedly ask to watch the same transit video clips. Parents report it is difficult to redirect him from this interest, and he becomes irritable if interrupted.\n\nSensory features: He is sensitive to certain sounds and textures. He covers his ears at the cafeteria and during the vacuum cleaner. Clothing tags and certain fabrics bother him; he refuses jeans and will only wear specific soft shirts. He also seeks sensory input at times, pressing his forehead against the couch or squeezing into tight spaces \"to feel calm.\" Parents state these sensory issues contribute to daily conflict and meltdowns.\n\nDevelopmental course: Symptoms were present early. Parents report delayed pragmatic language and atypical social engagement in toddlerhood: limited pointing to share interest, reduced response to his name, and preference for solitary play. First words were on time, but he used language in an unusual, overly formal way early on. He did not engage in typical pretend play with peers. These patterns have persisted, with increasing impairment in school and social functioning.\n\nFunctional impact: Social difficulties and rigidity interfere with classroom group work and peer relationships. Teacher notes he struggles with collaborative tasks, may correct others harshly, and can become overwhelmed by noise, leading to leaving the classroom without permission. At home, the family avoids outings due to sensory overload and distress with changes.\n\nMental status (during interview): Well-groomed boy, cooperative but somewhat aloof. Speech is fluent with somewhat atypical prosody and formal word choice; tends to provide lengthy, detail-heavy answers and returns repeatedly to transit topics. Mood described as \"fine\"; affect constricted. Thought process linear but perseverative. No delusions, hallucinations, or suicidal/homicidal ideation. Insight into social difficulties is limited; he states, \"Kids talk about pointless things.\" Judgment is fair for age.\n\nDifferential considerations addressed: There is no evidence of primary psychotic disorder, mania, or episodic mood disorder driving symptoms. Attention can be sustained for preferred tasks; distractibility appears situational and related to sensory overwhelm rather than pervasive inattention. Cognitive functioning is reported as average, and communication difficulties are not fully accounted for by intellectual limitations.\n\nSummary impression: Long-standing, early-onset pattern of social communication differences (limited reciprocity, atypical nonverbal communication, difficulty developing peer relationships) alongside restricted/repetitive behaviors (motor stereotypies, insistence on sameness, highly fixated interests) and sensory sensitivities, causing clinically significant impairment at school and home.",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m sinking and I can\u2019t pull myself out. I\u2019m also constantly on edge at work.\u201d\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient presents for evaluation of worsening mood and functioning over the past ~7 weeks. She reports a persistent low mood most of the day nearly every day, stating, \u201cI wake up and it\u2019s like there\u2019s a heavy blanket on me.\u201d She endorses marked loss of interest and enjoyment in activities she typically values (running, weekend outings with family, and cooking), saying, \u201cEven when I try, it feels pointless.\u201d Symptoms began after a major reorganization at work in which she was reassigned to a new supervisor and role with increased visibility. She initially experienced increased stress and self-doubt, followed by progressive mood decline.\n\nNeurovegetative and cognitive symptoms: Sleep is reduced with both initial and middle insomnia; she lies awake \u201creplaying emails\u201d and wakes around 3\u20134 AM \u201cwith my heart thumping,\u201d then has difficulty returning to sleep. Appetite is decreased with an unintentional ~8 lb weight loss over the last month. She describes low energy and easy fatigability (\u201cI\u2019m exhausted by noon\u201d), diminished concentration (\u201cI reread the same paragraph five times\u201d), and psychomotor slowing noted by the clinician as slowed speech and prolonged response latency. She reports feelings of worthlessness and excessive self-criticism: \u201cI\u2019m failing at work and at home. My team would be better off without me.\u201d She endorses guilt disproportionate to events, particularly about being less patient with her child.\n\nAnxiety features and diagnostic ambiguity: She reports feeling \u201con edge\u201d and tense during workdays, with muscle tension in her shoulders and occasional stomach upset. She describes worry about making mistakes at work and being judged in meetings. However, the worry is largely confined to work performance and tends to surge during mornings and before specific tasks (presentations, sending deliverables) rather than being broad across multiple life domains. She denies a long-standing history of excessive worry and reports that prior to this episode she was generally \u201ca planner, not a worrier.\u201d She estimates these anxious thoughts began around the same time as the depressed mood and have fluctuated with sleep and mood severity; on weekends, when mood is \u201cslightly less heavy,\u201d she notes the anxiety is less prominent. She denies persistent, uncontrollable worry occurring more days than not for many months; instead, she describes ruminative self-critical thoughts that \u201cloop\u201d about perceived failures. She denies panic attacks with sudden surges of intense fear, fear of dying, or avoidance behaviors.\n\nSuicidality: She endorses recurrent passive thoughts such as \u201cIt would be easier not to wake up\u201d occurring several times per week for the past 2\u20133 weeks. She denies active suicidal intent, plan, preparatory behaviors, or access to firearms. Protective factors include her child, spouse, and willingness to seek help. A safety plan is discussed.\n\nFunctioning: She reports significant impairment. At work she has missed two deadlines, is avoiding optional meetings, and received feedback about decreased responsiveness. At home she is doing minimal household tasks and feels emotionally withdrawn: \u201cI\u2019m there, but I\u2019m not really present.\u201d\n\nPast psychiatric history: No prior formal treatment. She recalls a milder period of low mood during college lasting \u201ca few weeks\u201d that resolved without care. No history of elevated mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, grandiosity, or risky behavior. No psychotic symptoms.\n\nMedical history: Hypothyroidism screening last year reportedly normal; no chronic pain conditions. No current medications other than an oral contraceptive. Denies recent steroid use. No recent infections or neurologic symptoms.\n\nSubstance use: Drinks 1\u20132 alcoholic beverages on weekends; denies binge use. Denies cannabis, stimulants, opioids, or other illicit substances. Caffeine 2\u20133 cups coffee/day, unchanged.\n\nFamily and social history: Mother had an episode of severe depression in her 40s treated with medication (patient unsure which). No family history of bipolar disorder. Married; spouse is supportive but \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d No current financial crisis. No history of trauma disclosed; she denies current domestic violence.\n\nMental status exam: Appearance mildly disheveled, psychomotor retardation, speech soft and slowed, mood \u201cdown,\u201d affect constricted and tearful at times. Thought process linear but ruminative. Thought content notable for guilt and passive death wishes without plan/intent. No hallucinations or delusions. Cognition grossly intact; attention reduced during interview. Insight and judgment fair.\n\nClinical summary: Over ~7 weeks the patient has had persistent depressed mood and marked loss of interest, accompanied by insomnia, decreased appetite/weight loss, fatigue, psychomotor slowing, impaired concentration, and excessive guilt/worthlessness, with passive suicidal ideation and clear functional impairment. Anxiety symptoms are present but appear episodic and primarily tied to depressive rumination and situational work stress, without a prolonged pattern of excessive uncontrollable worry across multiple domains.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. A is a 34-year-old accounting manager presenting for evaluation due to persistent, excessive worry and physical tension. She reports that for the past 10\u201312 months she has been \u201cworrying all day, every day,\u201d about multiple areas of life, including work performance, her child\u2019s health and school safety, household finances, and the possibility of making mistakes that could \u201cruin everything.\u201d She describes the worry as difficult to control: \u201cEven when I tell myself it\u2019s fine, my mind keeps running worst-case scenarios.\u201d She notes the worry occurs on most days and often begins shortly after waking.\n\nShe endorses associated symptoms occurring alongside the worry: feeling keyed up and restless (\u201cI can\u2019t relax; I\u2019m always on edge\u201d), becoming easily fatigued by afternoon despite adequate opportunity for rest, difficulty concentrating (\u201cI reread the same email five times\u201d), irritability with family members (\u201clittle things set me off\u201d), frequent muscle tension in her neck and shoulders with intermittent tension headaches, and sleep disturbance characterized by prolonged sleep onset due to rumination and occasional middle-of-the-night awakenings. She denies discrete surges of intense fear with palpitations or a sense of impending doom; instead, she describes a steady, persistent sense of apprehension.\n\nThe symptoms have caused clinically significant distress and impairment. At work she spends excessive time double-checking routine tasks, has missed deadlines due to over-preparing, and avoids delegating because she fears others will make errors. At home she reports being less patient and less present with her child, stating, \u201cI\u2019m physically there, but I\u2019m always mentally bracing for something bad.\u201d\n\nShe denies persistent low mood or loss of interest most days, and she continues to enjoy hobbies when she can disengage. She denies suicidal ideation, history of manic or hypomanic episodes, psychotic symptoms, trauma-related re-experiencing, compulsive rituals, or preoccupation focused solely on contamination, appearance, or a single circumscribed fear. She denies recent major medical changes. Review of medications is unremarkable; she is not taking stimulants or thyroid medication. She denies illicit drug use. There is no evidence that the symptoms are attributable to substance effects. She reports that her primary care clinician recently checked routine labs including thyroid studies, which were within normal limits.\n\nMental status examination: well-groomed, cooperative, mildly fidgety; speech normal rate and volume; mood \u201canxious,\u201d affect congruent and tense; thought process linear with prominent worry content; no delusions or hallucinations; cognition grossly intact though attention is distractible; insight and judgment fair. She is seeking treatment because she feels \u201cexhausted from worrying\u201d and wants strategies to regain control and improve sleep and functioning.",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \u201cI can\u2019t keep track of anything unless it\u2019s urgent, and I\u2019m always moving or interrupting people without meaning to.\u201d\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient presents for evaluation due to long-standing problems with attention regulation and restlessness that have become more impairing since starting a job with multiple simultaneous deadlines. She reports making frequent \u201ccareless mistakes\u201d in routine tasks (e.g., sending emails with missing attachments, overlooking details in reports) despite understanding the material. She describes difficulty sustaining focus in meetings and while reading: \u201cI reread the same paragraph five times and still don\u2019t absorb it.\u201d She often appears not to register what others say when spoken to directly, noting, \u201cMy mind is somewhere else even when I\u2019m looking at them.\u201d She struggles to follow through on instructions and to finish tasks: she starts projects with enthusiasm but \u201cdrops them halfway\u201d when steps pile up. She reports major difficulty organizing work (missed deadlines, cluttered desk, poor time estimation) and relies on last-minute pressure: \u201cIf it\u2019s not due today, it basically doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d She avoids tasks requiring sustained mental effort, particularly paperwork and expense reports. She frequently misplaces items (keys, badge, phone) and uses multiple tracking apps but forgets to check them. She is easily distracted by unrelated stimuli (notifications, background conversations) and describes being forgetful in daily activities (missing appointments unless reminded, forgetting to return messages).\n\nHyperactive/impulsive features are also prominent. She describes feeling internally \u201cdriven by a motor,\u201d with chronic restlessness. During the interview she shifts in her seat and repeatedly fidgets with her hands. She reports difficulty staying seated during long meetings, often finding reasons to stand or pace. At home she feels compelled to move: \u201cI pace on phone calls without noticing.\u201d She talks excessively and has trouble waiting her turn in group discussions. She frequently interrupts or finishes others\u2019 sentences: \u201cThe words come out before I can stop them,\u201d which has led to conflict with coworkers and her partner. She also describes impulsive decisions in low-stakes contexts (e.g., blurting comments, switching tasks abruptly) rather than thrill-seeking behavior.\n\nCourse and onset: Symptoms have been present since early childhood and were noticeable before middle school. She recalls frequent teacher comments such as \u201cbright but daydreams,\u201d \u201cdoesn\u2019t finish work,\u201d and \u201ctalks out of turn.\u201d She reports being \u201cconstantly in trouble for forgetting homework\u201d and needing parents to supervise morning routines due to distractibility. These symptoms persisted through adolescence and college, with variable grades depending on structure and interest level; she did best in hands-on or highly engaging classes. Current symptoms occur across multiple settings: at work (missed details, disorganization, interruptions), at home (unfinished chores, clutter, forgetting bills), and socially (interrupting, difficulty listening).\n\nFunctional impact: She reports significant impairment in occupational performance (multiple performance warnings for missed details and late deliverables), strained relationships due to interruptions and perceived inattention, and frequent stress from chronic disorganization. She uses coping strategies (calendars, alarms, to-do lists) but inconsistently follows them.\n\nAssociated features and exclusions: She denies sustained depressed mood, anhedonia, decreased need for sleep, episodic elevated mood, grandiosity, or increased goal-directed activity beyond her baseline restlessness. Sleep is 6\u20137 hours with difficulty \u201cshutting off\u201d thoughts, but no periods of markedly reduced sleep with high energy. She denies panic attacks, obsessions/compulsions, psychotic symptoms, or trauma-related re-experiencing. She denies current or past misuse of alcohol, stimulants, cannabis, or other substances. There is no history of seizures, head injury, or thyroid disease. She reports a family history of similar lifelong distractibility in her father.\n\nMental status (abbreviated): Well-groomed, cooperative; motor activity increased with fidgeting; speech normal rate/volume but occasionally rapid when excited; mood \u201cfrustrated\u201d; affect full range; thought process linear though tangential when describing examples; no delusions or hallucinations; cognition grossly intact; insight and judgment fair.\n\nOverall impression: The presentation describes a persistent pattern of inattention and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors beginning in childhood, occurring across settings, and causing clinically significant impairment, without evidence that the symptoms are better explained by another mental disorder or substance/medical condition.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. R is a 34-year-old paramedic referred by her primary care clinician for persistent sleep disturbance, irritability, and worsening concentration. She reports that 8 months ago she responded to a multi-vehicle highway collision in which several people were severely injured; one victim died while she was providing care. She recalls \"the smell of gas and the sound of someone screaming\" and states, \"I can still feel the blood on my gloves even though I know it\u2019s not there.\" Since the incident, she has experienced recurrent, intrusive memories of the scene that come \"out of nowhere\" several times per week and are triggered by sirens, screeching brakes, and the sight of mangled cars. She describes distressing dreams 2\u20133 nights per week in which she is \"back at the crash\" and wakes \"soaked in sweat\". On two occasions while driving past the crash site, she felt as if the event was happening again, describing a brief episode of feeling \"not in my body\" and \"watching myself from outside\" for a few minutes, followed by intense fear and shaking.\n\nShe reports persistent avoidance: she now refuses to drive on highways and takes longer surface streets, avoids watching news footage of accidents, and has asked supervisors to assign her away from major-trauma calls when possible. At home she avoids conversations about the event with colleagues and family, stating, \"If I start talking about it, I can\u2019t shut it off.\" She notes memory gaps for parts of that day: \"I remember arriving and then it\u2019s like there are chunks missing until the ambulance ride.\" She endorses ongoing negative emotional state and cognitive changes, including frequent guilt and self-blame (\"If I had moved faster, maybe he\u2019d still be alive\"), diminished interest in previously enjoyable activities (stopped going to the gym and weekend hikes), and feeling detached from friends (\"I\u2019m there, but I\u2019m not really with them\"). She has difficulty experiencing positive emotions: \"Even when something good happens, it doesn\u2019t land.\" She denies persistent auditory or visual hallucinations and denies delusional beliefs.\n\nShe describes marked arousal and reactivity changes since the event: difficulty falling asleep (often 2\u20133 hours to fall asleep) and frequent awakenings, irritability with verbal outbursts at coworkers, hypervigilance in public places (sits with back to the wall, scans exits), exaggerated startle response to sudden noises, and impaired concentration (missed details in routine reports). She reports somatic anxiety surges when triggered\u2014tight chest, nausea, and tremulousness\u2014lasting 10\u201320 minutes; she worries she is \"having a heart problem,\" though a recent cardiac workup was normal.\n\nSymptoms have persisted for more than 6 months and have caused clinically significant distress and functional impairment: increased sick days, a written warning for documentation errors, strained relationships, and near-miss while driving due to momentary distraction after hearing sirens. She reports drinking 2\u20133 glasses of wine on most nights \"to shut my brain off,\" which began after the crash; she denies morning drinking, withdrawal symptoms, or blackouts, but acknowledges tolerance compared with before and that alcohol \"doesn\u2019t really help anymore.\" She denies current illicit drug use. She denies active suicidal intent or plan, but endorses occasional passive thoughts such as \"it would be easier if I didn\u2019t wake up\" when sleep is worst; protective factors include responsibility to patients, close relationship with her sister, and future goals. She denies history of manic or hypomanic episodes. She reports no prior similar symptoms before the collision, though she had intermittent stress-related insomnia during training.\n\nMental status exam: well-groomed, cooperative, tearful at times; mood \"on edge\" with constricted affect; speech normal rate/volume; thought process linear; thought content notable for guilt and trauma-related ruminations without psychosis; attention mildly impaired; insight fair; judgment intact. Physiological arousal observed when describing the crash (hand tremor, tachypnea).",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \"My manager thinks I'm depressed because I'm quiet and I don't join lunches. I feel burnt out and misunderstood.\"\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient presents at the urging of their workplace after a recent performance review raised concerns about low engagement, limited participation in group discussions, and a \"flat\" presentation during meetings. They report feeling \"drained\" by social demands at work and say they often need to sit in their car for 20\u201330 minutes after work to \"decompress.\" They deny persistent sadness, stating: \"I\u2019m not crying or hopeless. It\u2019s more like my brain is overloaded.\" They describe periods of irritability and exhaustion that intensify after changes in routine (e.g., a recent team reorganization and new open-office seating), but they do not endorse a continuous 2-week period of depressed mood most of the day nearly every day. They deny suicidal ideation, intent, or plan, and deny past suicide attempts or self-harm.\n\nThey acknowledge that coworkers interpret their lack of facial expressiveness and limited eye contact as disinterest: \"People think I\u2019m mad. I\u2019m not mad. My face just doesn\u2019t do the thing they expect.\" They report longstanding discomfort with small talk and difficulty knowing when to speak in groups. In meetings they often rehearse what to say internally and may miss the moment to contribute; afterward they ruminate about whether their comments sounded \"wrong\" or too literal. They describe taking instructions literally and feeling distressed when expectations are implied rather than explicitly stated: \"If someone says, \u2018Can you get that done soon?\u2019 I need to know if that\u2019s today or tomorrow. I can\u2019t guess.\"\n\nSocial-developmental history (longstanding pattern): The patient reports these interpersonal patterns since early childhood. Their parents reportedly described them as \"independent\" and \"in their own world\" in preschool. They recall preferring solitary play and arranging toys in precise categories rather than role-play, and becoming upset when siblings moved items: \"It felt like my brain itched until it was put back.\" They had age-appropriate early speech but were described as overly formal and \"little professor\" in tone. They remember missing jokes and sarcasm: \"I didn\u2019t know people said things they didn\u2019t mean. I got in trouble a lot for \u2018talking back\u2019 when I was actually answering honestly.\" School records (per patient report) noted strong vocabulary and above-average test scores but frequent comments such as \"does not participate,\" \"works better alone,\" and \"difficulty with peer interactions.\" They report being bullied in middle school for being \"weird\" and \"robotic\" and avoiding the cafeteria due to noise.\n\nCurrent social functioning: They have one close friend they met online through a shared interest and prefer text-based communication because \"I can think before I respond.\" They report limited interest in broad socializing and find relationship maintenance effortful, though they express desire for companionship in a structured way: \"I want a friend I can see on a schedule.\" They have had two prior romantic relationships that ended due to misunderstandings about emotional communication; they say partners accused them of being uncaring because they did not express feelings in expected ways. They report difficulty reading subtle facial expressions and often rely on explicit verbal feedback.\n\nRestricted/repetitive patterns and sensory features: The patient describes a long-standing intense interest in public transit systems and timetables, stating: \"I can tell you which trains were retired in what year and why.\" They spend several hours per week reading technical forums and building spreadsheets for routes \"for fun\" and report this is comforting rather than distressing. They demonstrate a strong preference for routines and predictability, becoming significantly anxious and irritable with unexpected changes: \"If a meeting gets moved last minute, I can\u2019t focus for the rest of the day.\" They report repetitive self-soothing behaviors such as finger tapping, rubbing a smooth coin, and rocking subtly when overstimulated; they attempt to suppress these at work to avoid attention.\n\nThey describe sensory sensitivities that contribute to impairment: fluorescent lights cause headaches and \"buzzing\" discomfort; certain fabrics feel \"like sandpaper\"; and open-office noise is overwhelming. They wear noise-canceling headphones whenever possible and choose foods with consistent texture. They describe being unusually aware of background sounds (HVAC, keyboard clicks), which makes concentration difficult.\n\nMood, anxiety, and MDD overlap (diagnostic challenge): The patient reports occasional low mood and loneliness, especially after socially exhausting days, but denies anhedonia. They continue to experience pleasure and absorption in their interests, coding projects, and a weekly solo hike: \"When I\u2019m mapping routes or hiking, I feel calm and even happy.\" Appetite is stable; weight is unchanged. Sleep is variable primarily due to late-night hyperfocus on projects and difficulty transitioning to bed: \"I lose track of time.\" They deny pervasive feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, describing instead frustration about being misunderstood and worry about workplace expectations. Concentration is described as strong for preferred tasks and reduced in noisy, unstructured settings; they do not describe a global decline in cognition across domains. Psychomotor changes are not observed. Energy is reported as \"low after social stuff\" but improves with downtime and predictable routines.\n\nThey endorse situational anxiety around ambiguity and social evaluation (e.g., presentations, unstructured networking events) and report occasional shutdowns (going quiet, needing to leave) when overstimulated. They deny panic attacks, mania/hypomania, hallucinations, or delusions.\n\nMental status examination: Appearance neat, dressed comfortably with sensory-friendly clothing. Behavior cooperative; mildly tense. Eye contact intermittent; gaze often directed to the side when speaking. Speech fluent, somewhat formal, with occasional pedantic detail; normal rate and volume. Affect constricted but congruent with stated content; mood described as \"overloaded.\" Thought process linear and goal-directed; content without psychosis. Cognition grossly intact; attention improves when discussing special interests. Insight fair; judgment intact. No suicidal or homicidal ideation.\n\nFunctional impact: Work impairment noted in team-based settings requiring rapid, implicit social coordination; significant distress with open-office sensory load and frequent schedule changes. Independent living skills intact; finances organized via detailed spreadsheets; activities of daily living intact.\n\nSummary formulation: The presentation shows a lifelong pattern of social communication differences across contexts, reduced social reciprocity, atypical nonverbal communication (limited eye contact/expressiveness), difficulty developing and maintaining relationships, alongside restricted interests, need for sameness, repetitive self-soothing behaviors, and sensory sensitivities. Current complaints include fatigue, social withdrawal, and a constricted affect that could be misinterpreted as depression; however, the patient does not report a sustained depressive syndrome with pervasive depressed mood or anhedonia and lacks other core depressive features such as persistent hopelessness, guilt/worthlessness, appetite/weight change, or suicidality. Symptoms are better accounted for by longstanding neurodevelopmental patterns with situational stress and overstimulation at work.",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \"I feel like I'm running on empty and nothing matters anymore.\"\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient is a 34-year-old pediatric nurse presenting for evaluation of persistent mood and functional decline over the past 7\u20138 weeks. She describes nearly daily low mood, frequent tearfulness, and a marked loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities (stopped running, no longer looks forward to family outings). She reports a prominent sense of irritability, stating, \"I snap at my husband and then hate myself for it.\" She endorses fatigue most days and says she has been \"dragging\" through shifts, relying on extra caffeine.\n\nSleep is disrupted: difficulty falling asleep and frequent early-morning awakening, with non-restorative sleep even on days off. Appetite is reduced with an unintentional weight loss of about 8 pounds over ~6 weeks. She reports diminished concentration and indecisiveness, noting she rereads charting repeatedly and worries she will make errors. She describes feelings of worthlessness and excessive guilt: \"My coworkers are picking up my slack. My kid deserves a better mom.\" She denies hallucinations or delusional beliefs.\n\nShe reports intermittent episodes of intense anxiety with somatic symptoms (palpitations, chest tightness, trembling, and a fear of \"something terrible happening\"), occurring about once weekly, typically when anticipating work or after receiving a text from her manager. These episodes peak within minutes and resolve with pacing and controlled breathing; she has begun avoiding volunteer assignments and has called out of work twice, which is unusual for her.\n\nSuicidality: She endorses passive thoughts such as, \"If I didn\u2019t wake up, it would be a relief,\" occurring several times per week, but denies intent, plan, preparatory behaviors, or access to firearms. She identifies her child as a strong protective factor and agrees to seek help if thoughts intensify.\n\nCourse/precipitants: Symptoms began after a cluster of stressors including rotating night shifts, a recent move, and her mother\u2019s hospitalization for a stroke. She reports feeling \"stuck in survival mode\" since then. She denies similar episodes of this intensity in the past, though she recalls a brief period of low mood in college that resolved without treatment.\n\nPsychiatric/medical history: No prior psychiatric hospitalizations. No history suggestive of manic or hypomanic episodes (no periods of abnormally elevated mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, grandiosity, or risky behavior). No history of obsessive rituals. Migraines treated intermittently with sumatriptan; no recent medication changes. Denies thyroid disease. No recent infections. \n\nSubstance use: Drinks alcohol 1\u20132 drinks per week; denies escalation. Denies cannabis, stimulants, opioids, or misuse of prescriptions.\n\nFamily history: Father with history of heavy alcohol use; maternal aunt with recurrent mood symptoms treated outpatient (details unknown). \n\nMental status exam (abbrev.): Appears stated age, mildly disheveled after night shift. Psychomotor activity mildly slowed. Speech soft but coherent. Mood \"numb and sad\"; affect constricted with tearfulness. Thought process linear. Thought content notable for self-critical themes and passive death wishes without plan or intent. No psychosis. Cognition grossly intact, but attention impaired on serial tasks. Insight and judgment fair.\n\nFunctional impact: Decline in work performance and increased absenteeism; decreased engagement in parenting and household responsibilities. She reports social withdrawal and reduced communication with friends.\n\nRisk/medical considerations: Denies current pregnancy. No evidence that symptoms are better explained by a medical condition or substance effect based on history; she is amenable to basic lab screening via primary care (e.g., thyroid function, CBC) given fatigue and weight loss.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. R is a 34-year-old elementary school counselor who presents for evaluation due to persistent anxiety and difficulty sleeping that have gradually worsened over the past 8\u20139 months. She reports feeling \"on edge almost every day\" and describes excessive worry occurring more days than not across multiple areas, including work performance (fear of missing signs of distress in students), finances (concerns about unexpected expenses), her child\u2019s health (interpreting minor symptoms as serious illness), and her parents\u2019 aging. She states, \"My brain just keeps running scenarios\u2014if I stop paying attention for a second, something bad will happen.\" She finds the worry difficult to control and says reassurance from her spouse provides only brief relief before the worries shift to another topic.\n\nShe endorses associated physical and cognitive symptoms: restlessness (\"I can\u2019t sit through a TV show without getting up\"), easy fatigability (feels drained by mid-afternoon despite adequate opportunity for rest), difficulty concentrating (\"I reread the same email three times\"), irritability (snapping at family, then feeling guilty), muscle tension (tight neck and shoulders, frequent jaw clenching), and sleep disturbance characterized by prolonged sleep onset due to rumination and frequent awakenings with \"a jolt\" and racing thoughts. She reports intermittent tension headaches and episodes of gastrointestinal upset (loose stools and abdominal cramping) that flare when stress is high; she has been told by her primary care clinician that the GI symptoms appear stress-related, and basic labs were unremarkable.\n\nFunctionally, she continues to work but is spending excessive time checking and re-checking documentation and student notes, staying late to \"make sure nothing is missed,\" which is contributing to work-life imbalance and conflict at home. She avoids scheduling social plans because she worries she will be \"too tired or too keyed up.\" She denies discrete episodes of sudden terror with abrupt peak symptoms; instead, she describes a near-constant baseline of worry with occasional brief surges of anxiety before meetings or when receiving emails from administrators. She denies compulsive rituals (e.g., repetitive handwashing or counting) and does not describe intrusive images that feel alien to her; she experiences the worries as her own thoughts that are excessive but \"hard to shut off.\"\n\nMood is described as \"stressed and worn out\"; she reports reduced enjoyment in hobbies due to fatigue and mental preoccupation but denies persistent low mood most of the day nearly every day. She denies suicidal ideation, self-harm, or prior suicide attempts. She denies history of manic or hypomanic symptoms (no periods of decreased need for sleep with increased energy, grandiosity, pressured speech, or risky behavior). She denies hallucinations or delusional beliefs.\n\nSubstance use: drinks 2\u20133 cups of coffee daily and notices anxiety is worse on days she has an extra caffeinated beverage; drinks alcohol 1\u20132 drinks on weekends, denies binge use; denies tobacco or illicit substances. Medical history includes episodic migraines and the above GI complaints; no thyroid disease by history. Current medications: occasional ibuprofen; no psychiatric medications. Family history is notable for a mother described as a \"chronic worrier\" and a brother with a history of problematic alcohol use.\n\nOn mental status exam, she is cooperative, appropriately groomed, and mildly fidgety. Speech is normal rate and volume. Thought process is linear but ruminative. Thought content is notable for pervasive worries about multiple domains; no psychosis. Affect is anxious with full range. Cognition is grossly intact; attention is mildly impaired by distractibility. Insight is fair\u2014she recognizes her worry is excessive yet feels unable to control it.\n\nOverall, symptoms have been present more days than not for over six months, are difficult to control, are associated with multiple physical/cognitive symptoms, and are causing clinically significant distress and impairment in occupational efficiency and family functioning. There is no evidence from the history to suggest the symptoms are attributable to a substance, medication, or another medical condition, and no alternative primary psychiatric syndrome better accounts for the presentation.",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \"My brain feels like a browser with 40 tabs open. I'm always behind, and it's starting to scare me at work.\"\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient presents for evaluation of chronic problems with focus, organization, and follow-through that have become more impairing after taking a charge-nurse role 8 months ago. She describes persistent difficulty sustaining attention during charting and handoffs, frequently losing her place mid-note, and needing to reread the same paragraph multiple times. She reports making \"careless\" documentation errors (e.g., leaving fields blank, entering vitals in the wrong time column) and missing non-urgent pages because she becomes absorbed in an unrelated task. She says, \"If it's not urgent, it evaporates.\" She often starts tasks (ordering supplies, finishing required online modules) but leaves them incomplete due to distraction or shifting priorities.\n\nShe endorses significant disorganization: multiple half-finished lists, cluttered work bag, and chronic misplacement of keys/badge/phone. She describes forgetting appointments unless they are in her phone with multiple alarms and has missed at least three bills in the last two months despite adequate finances. Her partner reports she frequently asks for instructions to be repeated and forgets details of conversations, leading to conflict: \"She thinks I'm not listening, but I honestly lose the thread.\"\n\nHyperactive/impulsive features are described as longstanding restlessness and excessive talking. In session she shifts in her chair and fidgets with her ID lanyard. She reports feeling \"internally driven\" and uncomfortable sitting through meetings, often standing in the back or \"finding an excuse to do something.\" She interrupts others, finishes their sentences, and later feels embarrassed: \"I blurt it out before I can stop myself.\" She also describes impulsive spending on \"small dopamine things\" (online purchases under $50) and occasional speeding tickets, without episodes of elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, or other symptoms suggestive of a discrete mood episode.\n\nFunctional impact: At work, she has received a written warning for late completion of mandatory training and inconsistent documentation. She reports high subjective effort to \"mask\" symptoms, relying on last-minute adrenaline and working unpaid overtime to catch up. At home, she struggles to maintain routines (laundry, meal planning) and says her partner has taken over most household scheduling. She denies current job loss but fears she is \"one mistake away\" from serious consequences.\n\nDevelopmental/longitudinal history: The patient reports similar difficulties since childhood. She recalls teachers commenting that she was \"bright but daydreamy\" and that she talked excessively in class. She describes chronic procrastination, needing parental supervision to complete homework, and losing school materials. She says she could focus intensely on preferred activities (drawing, novels) for hours but could not sustain attention for chores or repetitive assignments. She denies a history of intellectual disability or learning disorder diagnosis; she reports average-to-high grades achieved through cramming and staying up late. She reports that these attention and organization difficulties persisted through college and have been present across settings (school, work, home).\n\nTrauma-related history and diagnostic ambiguity: Two years ago, she participated in a resuscitation of a teenager after a motor vehicle collision. She describes the event as upsetting and states she felt \"shaky\" afterward. Since that time, she endorses mild physiologic startle to unexpected loud noises in the ED and occasional irritability when overwhelmed, which she interprets as \"being on edge.\" However, she denies recurrent intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares related to the event. She does not avoid reminders (continues working in the same setting, can discuss the case without marked distress, and does not avoid driving or accident scenes). She denies persistent negative beliefs about herself or others related to the event, emotional numbing, detachment, or persistent guilt/blame specifically tied to the incident. Her sleep is variably affected by rotating shifts, but she does not describe trauma-specific sleep disturbance. Overall, her concentration problems clearly predate the event and were present in childhood; she notes the trauma experience \"made work feel heavier,\" but did not initiate the attention difficulties.\n\nPsychiatric review of systems: Denies current major depressive episode (no sustained depressed mood or anhedonia most days for at least 2 weeks), though she reports situational frustration and self-criticism about performance. Denies panic attacks. Denies obsessions/compulsions. Denies psychotic symptoms. Denies suicidal ideation, plan, or intent. No history of self-harm.\n\nSubstance/medical history: Drinks alcohol 1\u20132 drinks on weekends; denies binge patterns. Denies cannabis or other illicit substances. Rare caffeine use limited by palpitations. No history of head injury with loss of consciousness. No known thyroid disease. No current medications other than occasional ibuprofen.\n\nFamily history: Father described as \"always late and scattered\" and had occupational instability; no formal diagnoses known. Mother with history of generalized anxiety. No family history of bipolar disorder or psychotic disorders reported.\n\nMental status (abbreviated): Well-groomed, cooperative. Speech normal rate/volume but talkative and tangential at times. Mood \"stressed\"; affect full range, mildly anxious. Thought process generally linear but occasionally circumstantial with easy distractibility to environmental stimuli. No delusions/hallucinations. Cognition grossly intact; attention fluctuates during interview. Insight and judgment fair.\n\nClinical formulation summary: The presentation is characterized by chronic, cross-situational inattentiveness (difficulty sustaining focus, disorganization, forgetfulness, losing items, failure to follow through), combined with restlessness and impulsive verbal behavior, beginning in childhood and causing clinically significant impairment in occupational and home functioning. Trauma exposure is reported, but the symptom pattern lacks the hallmark intrusion and avoidance phenomena and does not temporally account for the longstanding attentional symptoms.",

    "clinical_text": "34-year-old paramedic presents for outpatient psychiatric evaluation at the urging of her supervisor after repeated call-outs and a recent on-scene incident where she \"froze\" and had to be relieved by a colleague. She reports that 8 months ago she responded to a multi-vehicle collision involving a tanker fire. She was first into a crushed car where the driver was trapped and screaming; the patient attempted airway support while flames spread. The driver died before extrication. She states, \"I can still smell the burning plastic and hear him begging me not to let him die.\" She denies any history of similar symptoms prior to that event.\n\nSince the collision, she describes recurrent, involuntary distressing memories that intrude \"out of nowhere\" several times per week, often triggered by sirens, the smell of gasoline, or seeing wrecked vehicles on the highway. She endorses nightmares 2\u20133 nights per week in which she relives the scene; she wakes sweating, tachycardic, and checks the door locks. Twice in the past month she experienced brief episodes at work where she felt as if she was \"back inside the car\" for several seconds, describing narrowed awareness and delayed response to coworkers (she later learned she was staring and not answering). During these episodes she reports marked distress and physical reactivity (shaking, nausea, racing heart).\n\nShe has begun avoiding reminders: she takes longer routes to avoid the highway near the crash site, refuses dispatches involving major roadways when she can, and has stopped watching news stories involving accidents. She states, \"I don\u2019t talk about that call. If I start, I can\u2019t shut it off.\" She avoids colleagues\u2019 debriefings and becomes tense when coworkers bring up the incident.\n\nShe reports persistent negative emotional state with prominent fear and guilt. She repeatedly states, \"I should have done more\u2026 I failed him,\" despite acknowledging intellectually that the fire and entrapment were not under her control. She describes reduced interest in previously enjoyed activities (running, dating), feeling detached from friends, and \"like I\u2019m watching my life through glass.\" She has difficulty experiencing positive emotions: \"Even when something good happens, it doesn\u2019t land.\" She notes patchy memory for parts of the call (she cannot recall who removed the patient\u2019s seatbelt or the exact sequence of events), which she finds unsettling.\n\nArousal symptoms include insomnia (sleep onset 2\u20133 hours, frequent awakenings), irritability and verbal outbursts at coworkers, hypervigilance (sits with her back to the wall in restaurants, scans for exits), exaggerated startle response to sudden sounds, and poor concentration leading to documentation errors. She reports a recent near-miss while driving due to being distracted by intrusive images. Symptoms have been present for more than 6 months and have caused clinically significant occupational impairment (disciplinary warning, reduced shifts) and social withdrawal.\n\nShe denies current suicidal intent or plan, though she reports transient thoughts such as \"it would be easier not to wake up\" after nights of nightmares; she identifies her sister as a protective factor and agrees to safety planning. No history of manic or hypomanic episodes. She denies hallucinations or fixed delusions; reality testing is intact outside of brief re-experiencing episodes.\n\nShe reports drinking \"a couple shots\" most nights to fall asleep, increasing from occasional social use prior to the crash; she denies morning drinking, withdrawal symptoms, or legal consequences, but acknowledges tolerance and that alcohol worsens her sleep quality. Medical history is unremarkable. She takes no regular medications. On mental status exam, she is tense and intermittently tearful, with constricted affect; speech is normal rate and volume; thought process linear; cognition grossly intact; attention mildly impaired during discussion of the traumatic event. When recounting details, she becomes visibly tremulous and asks to stop, stating, \"My chest is tight\u2014I can\u2019t breathe,\" which resolves with grounding and paced breathing.",

    "clinical_text": "Referral reason: Patient self-referred at the encouragement of her partner after ongoing interpersonal misunderstandings at work and in relationships, despite strong technical performance.\n\nPresenting concerns: The patient describes persistent difficulty navigating social situations and \"always feeling like there are hidden rules.\" She reports frequent misinterpretation of indirect communication and sarcasm, stating, \"If someone doesn\u2019t say what they mean, I don\u2019t know what to do with it.\" She describes conversations as effortful and strategic rather than intuitive: \"I rehearse what to say in my head. If the script changes, I freeze.\" She reports that after social gatherings she feels exhausted and needs prolonged time alone to recover.\n\nSocial communication/interaction: At work, she is viewed as highly detail-oriented but \"blunt\" in emails and meetings. She reports recurrent conflicts related to tone and perceived inflexibility. She struggles with reciprocal conversation, often shifting to factual or technical content and having difficulty detecting when others are bored or want to speak. She states, \"I can talk for ages about testing frameworks, but I don\u2019t notice I\u2019m doing it until someone interrupts.\" She reports difficulty forming and maintaining friendships, noting that she has had one close friend since high school but otherwise tends to have acquaintances without deeper connection. In romantic relationships, she reports difficulty interpreting nonverbal cues and implied expectations: \"I don\u2019t pick up hints. If you want something, you have to tell me plainly.\" She reports eye contact feels unnatural and effortful: \"I can do it, but it\u2019s like staring at the sun.\" She describes consciously copying others\u2019 facial expressions and phrases to appear engaged, and feels distressed when she is unsure how she is being perceived.\n\nRestricted/repetitive patterns and rigidity: She reports long-standing, highly focused interests that have been intense and narrow. In childhood she memorized bus routes and could recite schedules; currently she is intensely focused on software testing standards and also maintains a catalog of metro maps, which she studies for relaxation. She describes spending hours organizing her map collection and reading about transit system design, stating, \"It\u2019s soothing. I lose track of time.\" She endorses strong preference for routines and predictability. She becomes significantly distressed by unexpected changes in plans, even minor ones: \"If my morning routine gets interrupted, my whole day feels off.\" She describes needing advance notice to prepare for transitions and has left social events abruptly when plans changed. She reports repetitive behaviors when anxious or overstimulated, including finger tapping and rubbing the seam of her clothing; she notes she does this more when concentrating or in crowded spaces.\n\nSensory features: She reports sensory sensitivities present since childhood, including discomfort with certain fabric textures, strong aversion to fluorescent lighting, and being overwhelmed by multiple simultaneous sounds. She carries noise-reducing earbuds and avoids busy restaurants because \"my brain can\u2019t filter the noise.\" She also reports a narrow range of preferred foods based on texture rather than taste.\n\nDevelopmental history: Per the patient and collateral from her mother (phone interview), early language milestones were on time and she was an early reader. As a child she preferred solitary play, lined up toys, and became upset if family members rearranged her belongings. She had difficulty with pretend play with peers and was described as \"little professor-ish\" and \"more comfortable with adults.\" She was frequently teased for being \"odd\" and had few friends. Teachers noted exceptional accuracy and attention to detail but frequent frustration when classroom routines changed. There is no history suggesting global developmental delay or loss of skills.\n\nFunctioning/impairment: She has maintained employment but reports that social demands, team-based work, and workplace politics are persistent sources of stress and have contributed to performance reviews citing \"communication style\" despite high output. She has difficulty with collaborative group projects due to preference for clear rules and predictability. In daily living she is independent but rigid about scheduling, meal planning, and organizing her living space.\n\nComorbid features (mild): She reports chronic anticipatory anxiety around social interactions and meetings, with physiological symptoms (tachycardia, sweating) and avoidance of networking events. She denies panic attacks with sudden onset unrelated to triggers. She reports periods of low mood following interpersonal conflict but denies sustained depressive episodes, anhedonia, suicidality, or mania/hypomania. She endorses occasional difficulty initiating tasks unless requirements are clearly defined, but attention and impulse control are otherwise adequate; no history of disruptive behavior. She denies hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized thought. Sleep is variable; she often needs a strict bedtime routine to fall asleep.\n\nMental status exam (summary): Appearance neat, somewhat formal dress; behavior cooperative, mildly fidgety with fingers; speech fluent and articulate with occasionally pedantic phrasing; affect constricted but congruent; mood \"mostly anxious\"; thought process logical and detail-focused; no psychotic content; insight fair; judgment intact.\n\nRisk and differential considerations: No current suicidal or homicidal ideation. Presentation is long-standing with early developmental features, persistent social-communication difficulties across contexts, restricted interests, sensory sensitivities, and functional impairment. Symptoms are not better explained by intellectual disability, primary psychotic disorder, or solely by social anxiety (anxiety appears secondary to repeated social difficulties and uncertainty).",

She reports, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m moving through wet cement,\u201d and states she has stopped enjoying activities she previously looked forward to, including reading and weekend outings with her family: \u201cEven when I have free time, I just sit there and stare.\u201d She describes feeling emotionally numb and irritable, with frequent tearfulness. Her spouse encouraged the visit after noticing she has been more withdrawn and \u201csnaps over little things.\u201d\n\nSleep is significantly disrupted, with difficulty initiating sleep and early morning awakening (typically awake at 4\u20135 a.m. and unable to return to sleep). She feels unrefreshed and fatigued throughout the day, relying on extra caffeine but still struggling to get through classes. Appetite has decreased; she reports she \u201cforgets to eat\u201d and estimates an unintentional 8-pound weight loss over the past month. She endorses low energy, slowed productivity, and difficulty completing routine tasks (e.g., grading, household chores). Concentration has worsened: \u201cI read the same email five times and it doesn\u2019t stick,\u201d leading to missed deadlines and increased mistakes at work.\n\nShe reports prominent self-critical thoughts and excessive guilt, stating, \u201cI\u2019m a terrible mom and a terrible teacher,\u201d despite no objective evidence of major failures. She describes feeling hopeless about improvement: \u201cI can\u2019t see a way out of this.\u201d Psychomotor changes are subtle but observable during the interview: she appears slowed, with decreased spontaneous movement and longer response latency; she denies episodes of agitation.\n\nShe acknowledges recurrent thoughts that life is not worth living over the last two weeks. She denies a current plan or intent but reports passive thoughts such as, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t wake up, that would be fine.\u201d She denies past suicide attempts and denies access to firearms; she agrees to involve her spouse in safety planning and to seek emergency help if thoughts intensify.\n\nShe also endorses increased worry and physical tension, especially at night, describing \u201ca tight chest and racing thoughts about work,\u201d but she denies discrete panic attacks. Somatic complaints (headaches, stomach \u201cknots\u201d) have led her to visit primary care; basic labs reportedly were normal, and she was told stress might be contributing. She denies recent illness, thyroid disease, anemia, or new medications.\n\nShe denies any history of periods lasting several days with abnormally elevated or expansive mood, decreased need for sleep with high energy, unusually increased goal-directed activity, risky spending, or inflated self-esteem. She denies hallucinations, delusional beliefs, or paranoia. There is no recent substance use, and she denies misuse of prescription medications. She reports no recent bereavement or other single acute loss; stressors include increased workload and conflict with a colleague, but symptoms persist beyond situational frustration and are pervasive across settings.\n\nFunctionally, she has used two sick days in the past month, has fallen behind on lesson planning, and avoids social interactions. At home she is less engaged with her child and feels distressed by this change. She seeks help because the symptoms are persistent, impairing, and \u201cnot like me.\u201d",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. R is a 34-year-old project manager who presents to an outpatient clinic for \u201cconstant worrying\u201d and worsening sleep. She reports that for the past 10\u201312 months she has felt \u201con edge most days,\u201d with persistent worries that shift across multiple areas: work performance and deadlines (\u201cI\u2019m sure I missed something and it\u2019ll blow up\u201d), finances (\u201cIf something unexpected happens, we won\u2019t cope\u201d), her child\u2019s safety (\u201cI replay whether I buckled the car seat right\u201d), and health concerns (\u201cIf I feel a weird pain, my mind goes straight to something serious\u201d). She describes the worry as excessive relative to the situations, occurring more days than not, and difficult to control: \u201cEven when I tell myself it\u2019s irrational, it doesn\u2019t stop\u2014my brain keeps scanning for the next thing to worry about.\u201d\n\nShe notes associated physical and cognitive symptoms most days, including restlessness (\u201cI can\u2019t relax; I\u2019m always bracing\u201d), easy fatigue by mid-afternoon, difficulty concentrating (\u201cI read the same email three times and still miss details\u201d), irritability with her spouse and child (\u201cI snap, then feel guilty\u201d), muscle tension in her neck and shoulders, and frequent headaches. Sleep is disrupted by prolonged sleep onset due to rumination and intermittent nighttime awakenings; she typically sleeps 4\u20136 hours and feels unrefreshed. She reports occasional gastrointestinal discomfort and alternating diarrhea/constipation during high-stress weeks; she has been told by her primary care clinician that her exam and basic labs were unremarkable.\n\nFunctionally, she remains employed and is not missing work, but describes reduced efficiency and increased reassurance-seeking. She spends 1\u20132 hours most evenings rechecking calendars, re-reading messages, and reviewing household safety tasks (doors locked, stove off) \u201cso I can try to shut my mind down.\u201d She avoids delegating tasks at work because \u201cif I don\u2019t control it, something will go wrong,\u201d which has strained relationships with colleagues. She recognizes these behaviors are excessive and time-consuming, and she feels distressed by her inability to \u201cjust let things go.\u201d\n\nShe denies discrete episodes of sudden intense fear with prominent surges of autonomic symptoms peaking within minutes; she does report occasional brief waves of feeling overwhelmed (e.g., heart racing for a few minutes when an email from her supervisor arrives), but these occur in the context of ongoing worry rather than unexpected attacks. She endorses mild low mood and decreased enjoyment on some days but denies persistent depressed mood most of the day nearly every day for two weeks, marked anhedonia, or suicidal ideation. She denies history of manic or hypomanic symptoms (no periods of abnormally elevated/expansive mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, pressured speech, or risky behavior).\n\nShe denies intrusive, unwanted images or urges accompanied by ritualized behaviors aimed at neutralizing them; her checking is described as an attempt to reduce ongoing worry rather than driven by specific intrusive obsessions. She reports some self-consciousness in meetings but does not describe a primary fear of negative evaluation across most social situations; her central concern is making mistakes and the downstream consequences.\n\nMedical history is notable for episodic tension headaches and intermittent gastrointestinal symptoms. She takes no psychotropic medications. She drinks 3\u20134 cups of coffee daily and notes her \u201cjitters are worse\u201d on high-caffeine days; she denies illicit drug use. Alcohol use is 1\u20132 drinks on weekends; she denies withdrawal symptoms and does not use alcohol to manage anxiety. She is not pregnant and is using contraception. Family history includes a mother described as \u201ca lifelong worrier.\u201d\n\nMental status examination: well-groomed, cooperative, with mildly fidgety psychomotor activity. Speech normal rate and volume. Mood \u201cstressed,\u201d affect anxious but congruent and reactive. Thought process linear; thought content notable for excessive worry and catastrophic predictions; no delusions, hallucinations, or suicidal/homicidal ideation. Cognition grossly intact though attention is subjectively impaired. Insight and judgment fair.\n\nOverall, she describes pervasive worry across multiple domains for >6 months, difficulty controlling the worry, associated somatic and cognitive symptoms, and clinically significant distress with impairment in work efficiency and family functioning. There is no evidence that symptoms are due to a substance, another medical condition, or better explained by another primary mental disorder.",

    "clinical_text": "28-year-old man presents for evaluation due to long-standing problems with attention, organization, and restlessness that have worsened in the context of increased workload. He reports he is \"constantly starting things and not finishing\" and that he \"reads the same paragraph three times\" before it sticks. At work, he frequently makes careless mistakes on routine tickets, misses key details in emails, and forgets to follow through unless reminders are set. He describes difficulty sustaining attention during meetings, stating, \"After five minutes my brain is somewhere else,\" and he often finds himself checking unrelated tabs or doodling. He endorses frequent procrastination, especially for tasks requiring sustained mental effort (documentation, expense reports), noting, \"I\u2019ll avoid it until the last minute and then panic.\" He misplaces items daily (badge, earbuds, phone) and describes being easily distracted by external stimuli such as office conversations and notifications: \"If someone walks by, I lose my train of thought.\" He also reports forgetfulness in daily activities, including missing appointments unless multiple alarms are used and forgetting to return calls/texts.\n\nHe additionally describes a persistent sense of restlessness. He fidgets with his hands, taps his foot, and shifts in his chair throughout the interview. He reports difficulty remaining seated during long meetings and at restaurants: \"I feel like I need to get up or I\u2019m crawling out of my skin.\" He often feels \"on the go\" and chooses tasks that allow movement. He acknowledges excessive talking and sometimes interrupting others: \"I answer before they finish the question.\" He reports impatience while waiting in lines or during slow conversations and occasionally blurts out comments he later regrets. His partner describes him as \"always in motion\" and notes he frequently cuts in during discussions and forgets agreed-upon chores.\n\nDevelopmental history reveals symptoms began in childhood and were present before age 12. He recalls being repeatedly told by teachers that he was \"bright but doesn\u2019t apply himself,\" frequently daydreamed, forgot homework, and had a messy desk/backpack. Report cards commonly noted difficulty staying on task and talking in class. He reports needing parental supervision to complete assignments and often rushing through work with avoidable errors. These difficulties persisted through high school and college, where he struggled with planning, studying consistently, and meeting deadlines despite adequate intellectual ability.\n\nSymptoms occur across multiple settings: at work (missed details, incomplete tasks, distractibility, lateness) and at home (forgetting errands, losing items, difficulty finishing chores, interrupting conversations). Functional impact is significant: he has received a formal performance warning for missed follow-ups, his partner reports frequent conflict about reliability, and he experiences chronic stress and reduced self-confidence due to repeated mistakes and last-minute scrambling.\n\nHe denies episodes of elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, or goal-directed overactivity suggestive of a manic/hypomanic syndrome. He denies persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, suicidal ideation, hallucinations, or paranoia. He reports mild situational anxiety related to work performance but states it follows from \"messing up and falling behind\" rather than being pervasive. Sleep is generally 7\u20138 hours with occasional difficulty winding down due to racing thoughts about unfinished tasks; no snoring or witnessed apneas are reported. Appetite and weight are stable. He denies history of head injury, seizures, or thyroid disease.\n\nMental status examination: Well-groomed, cooperative. Psychomotor activity notable for fidgeting and frequent shifting in seat. Speech normal rate/volume but mildly circumstantial with occasional tangential shifts; easily redirected. Mood \"stressed\"; affect congruent, full range. Thought process logical overall; no delusions or perceptual disturbances. Cognition grossly intact; attention during interview intermittently drifts (requests repetition of a question once, glances toward hallway noises). Insight and judgment fair. No safety concerns endorsed.\n\nOverall presentation is characterized by persistent inattention (careless errors, difficulty sustaining attention, not following through, disorganization, avoidance of sustained mental effort, losing things, distractibility, forgetfulness) and hyperactive/impulsive features (fidgeting, restlessness, difficulty remaining seated, feeling driven, excessive talking, interrupting, impatience), with onset in childhood, presence in more than one setting, and clear functional impairment. Symptoms are not better accounted for by a primary mood, psychotic, or substance-related condition based on current history.",

    "clinical_text": "Mr. R is a 32-year-old emergency department nurse referred by occupational health for persistent anxiety, sleep disturbance, and declining work performance following a violent incident at work 8 months ago. He reports that during a night shift, an armed individual entered the department and fired multiple shots. He was pinned behind a desk with two coworkers while hearing patients and staff screaming; he saw a colleague struck and later learned the colleague died. He states, \u201cI can still see the blood on the floor when I close my eyes. I thought, \u2018This is it, I\u2019m going to die here.\u2019\u201d\n\nSince the incident, he describes recurrent, involuntary memories that \u201chit me like a wave\u201d several times per day, often triggered by loud noises, the smell of antiseptic, or the sound of carts rolling. He reports nightmares 3\u20134 nights per week: \u201cI\u2019m back in the hallway and I can\u2019t move, and the gunshots won\u2019t stop.\u201d On two occasions, he describes episodes at work where he briefly felt as though the event was happening again; he ducked under a workstation and \u201clost track of where I was for a few seconds.\u201d He becomes visibly tense when recounting these episodes and says his heart races and he starts sweating when he passes the trauma bay.\n\nHe avoids reminders by taking longer routes through the hospital to bypass the corridor where the shooting occurred, refuses to watch news about violence, and will not discuss the incident with coworkers. \u201cIf someone brings it up, I shut down\u2014I\u2019ll leave the room.\u201d He reports trying to push the memories away, but \u201cthe more I fight it, the louder it gets.\u201d\n\nHe endorses persistent negative emotional and cognitive changes since the incident. He reports frequent guilt (\u201cI should have done more; I was the nurse\u2014I froze\u201d) despite acknowledging the circumstances. He describes a sense of foreshortened future: \u201cI don\u2019t plan anything anymore. It feels pointless.\u201d He reports diminished interest in previously enjoyed activities (basketball, game nights) and feels detached from others: \u201cMy wife says I\u2019m there but not really there.\u201d He notes a reduced ability to experience positive emotions: \u201cEven when something good happens, I feel flat.\u201d\n\nArousal/reactivity symptoms are prominent. He describes being on edge constantly, scanning exits in restaurants, sitting with his back to the wall, and startling intensely at sudden noises (\u201cIf a tray clatters, I jump out of my skin\u201d). He is irritable and has had verbal outbursts at home (\u201cI snapped at my kid for dropping a cup; that\u2019s not me\u201d). Sleep is fragmented with prolonged sleep onset and frequent awakenings. Concentration is impaired (\u201cI reread the same charting line five times\u201d). He denies reckless driving or substance escalation.\n\nThe presentation has created a diagnostic challenge because he has developed behaviors that superficially resemble a longstanding neurodevelopmental social-communication style: he now avoids eye contact in sessions, speaks in a constrained, monotone voice, and can appear \"robotic\" when discussing feelings. He has become rigid about routines (insists on checking door locks in a fixed sequence, needs predictable seating in public places) and reports strong discomfort with certain sounds (sirens, metal clanging) and crowded environments. However, he and his spouse describe that prior to the workplace incident he had flexible routines, tolerated crowds, and was socially reciprocal\u2014he enjoyed spontaneous outings, maintained close friendships, and was comfortable reading social cues in a fast-paced team environment. He reports normal early development, no childhood history of persistent social-communication difficulties, no longstanding restricted interests, and no history of being described as \"odd\" or socially disconnected during school years. The current social withdrawal and sensory avoidance are described as new-onset and specifically linked to fear and physiological arousal around reminders of the violent event.\n\nHe denies current hallucinations, mania, or primary obsessive intrusive thoughts unrelated to the incident. He denies suicidal intent, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t want to die\u2014I just want my brain to stop.\u201d He reports one panic-like episode when a patient\u2019s family member yelled in the waiting room, which he identified as reminding him of the shooting. Medical history is notable only for mild asthma; he is not taking steroids or stimulants. No head injury occurred during the incident. He denies significant alcohol use, and collateral from his spouse supports that he is not intoxicated or withdrawing when symptoms occur.\n\nSymptoms have persisted for more than 6 months, cause significant distress, and have impaired functioning: he has requested repeated shift changes, has called out of work, avoids high-acuity rooms, and reports strain in his marriage due to emotional distance and irritability. Mental status exam shows an alert, oriented man with anxious affect, intermittent tearfulness when describing the event, guarded posture, and hypervigilant scanning of the room; thought process is linear; no psychosis; insight is fair. He acknowledges that these changes began after the shooting and states, \u201cI used to be calm in chaos. Now chaos feels like it\u2019s hunting me.\u201d",

I\u2019m fine when things are predictable, but social stuff is exhausting.\u201d\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient presents for evaluation at the suggestion of his academic advisor due to longstanding social and communication difficulties and increasing distress as coursework becomes more collaborative. He reports chronic difficulty with back-and-forth conversation, stating, \u201cIf it\u2019s not about something specific, I don\u2019t get the point.\u201d In interviews, he frequently gives highly detailed, fact-based responses, does not spontaneously ask reciprocal questions, and often misses implied meanings. He describes repeated misunderstandings in group projects, noting, \u201cThey think I\u2019m arguing when I\u2019m just correcting errors.\u201d He acknowledges trouble recognizing when others are bored or offended unless they state it explicitly.\n\nSocial communication and interaction: He reports having had very few friends throughout childhood and adolescence and currently has no close friends on campus, describing relationships as \u201cconfusing\u201d and \u201ca lot of maintenance.\u201d He prefers solitary activities and typically eats alone. He has difficulty initiating social contact and maintaining peer relationships, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to join in unless there\u2019s a clear role.\u201d Roommates describe him as polite but \u201cdistant,\u201d rarely participating in casual conversation. He reports being told that his facial expression is \u201cflat\u201d and that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t look interested\u201d even when he is. During the interview, eye contact is intermittent and often avoided during emotional topics; his gestures are limited, and his prosody can sound monotone. He struggles with interpreting nonverbal cues and sarcasm, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t tell when someone is joking unless it\u2019s obvious.\u201d\n\nRestricted and repetitive behaviors/interests: Since early childhood, he has had intense, circumscribed interests. Currently, he is preoccupied with train timetables and transit system design, spending hours daily mapping routes and memorizing schedules \u201cfor fun.\u201d He reports that these interests are soothing and that he becomes irritated when interrupted. He also exhibits insistence on sameness and difficulty with transitions: he follows a rigid daily routine (same breakfast, same route to class, same study schedule) and becomes markedly distressed if plans change unexpectedly, describing feeling \u201cpanicky and overloaded\u201d when a class is moved or a meeting starts late. He reports repetitive behaviors under stress, including finger flicking and rocking while studying, which he tries to hide in public.\n\nSensory features: He endorses longstanding sensory sensitivities, especially to noise and certain textures. He avoids cafeterias because \u201cthe sounds blend together and it hurts,\u201d wears noise-canceling headphones daily, and becomes overwhelmed in crowded environments. He reports strong aversion to particular clothing fabrics and tags, and he is extremely selective about food textures.\n\nDevelopmental history: His mother reports that as a toddler he spoke his first words on time but used language in unusual ways, including \u201clittle adult phrases\u201d and scripted lines from favorite videos. He tended to talk at length about preferred topics without noticing listeners\u2019 reactions. In preschool and elementary school, teachers noted he played alone, lined up toys by color, and became upset if objects were moved. He had difficulty with imaginative peer play and preferred organizing and categorizing activities. These patterns were present across home and school settings.\n\nFunctional impact: Symptoms have caused clinically significant impairment in social and academic functioning. He reports chronic isolation and frequent conflict during collaborative assignments. He has strengths in structured, rule-based tasks and performs well in exams, but struggles with open-ended group work, networking, and interviews. He is not currently in a romantic relationship and reports difficulty understanding dating norms.\n\nPsychiatric review of systems and differential considerations: He denies hallucinations, delusions, episodes of elevated mood, or decreased need for sleep. He describes situational anxiety in unpredictable social settings and during sensory overload but no discrete panic attacks. Mood is generally \u201cokay\u201d though he feels lonely at times; he denies suicidal ideation. There is no history of substance use disorder. Cognitive functioning appears average to above average; academic performance is strong in technical courses. No history suggests a primary psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, or a primary language disorder. The lifelong pattern of social-communication differences and restricted/repetitive behaviors beginning in early development and causing functional impairment is prominent.\n\nMental status exam (selected): Well-groomed young man, cooperative. Speech fluent but overly formal and occasionally pedantic; normal rate and volume. Affect restricted; mood \u201cfine.\u201d Thought process logical and concrete; thought content without psychosis. Eye contact reduced; limited spontaneous social reciprocity. Insight partial (\u201cI know I\u2019m different socially; I don\u2019t always see it in the moment\u201d). Judgment fair. Attention and memory grossly intact.",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \u201cI can\u2019t feel anything anymore, and I\u2019m exhausted all the time.\u201d\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient presents for outpatient psychiatric evaluation after her primary care clinician noted worsening mood and passive suicidal thoughts. She reports approximately 7\u20138 weeks of persistently low mood \u201cmost of the day, nearly every day,\u201d with a marked loss of interest in activities she previously enjoyed (running, cooking, and socializing). \u201cEven when I have time off, I just sit there. Nothing sounds worth it.\u201d She describes significant fatigue (\u201clike walking through wet cement\u201d) and difficulty concentrating at work, leading to near-miss medication errors and increased charting mistakes. Coworkers have commented that she appears \u201cchecked out.\u201d\n\nSleep has been disrupted with early-morning awakenings (waking around 3\u20134 a.m. and unable to return to sleep), and she reports diminished appetite with an unintentional weight loss of about 10 pounds over the past month. She endorses prominent guilt and self-critical thoughts: \u201cI\u2019m failing my patients and my family. I\u2019m a burden.\u201d She notes psychomotor slowing noticed by her spouse (\u201cYou move like you\u2019re underwater\u201d), and she describes being tearful with low frustration tolerance.\n\nSuicidality: She reports passive suicidal ideation several times per week: \u201cSometimes I think it would be easier not to wake up.\u201d She denies current intent or plan, denies preparatory behaviors, and agrees to collaborative safety planning. She denies past suicide attempts or self-injury.\n\nPotential trauma-related overlap / diagnostic challenge: Approximately 4 months ago, she was involved in a motor vehicle collision while driving home from a night shift; another driver ran a red light, and her car spun into a barrier. She sustained minor bruising but required no surgery. She reports feeling \u201cshaken\u201d for a couple of weeks afterward and briefly avoided the intersection for about 10 days, but she resumed her usual route and driving without panic. She does not describe recurrent distressing memories that intrude against her will; rather, she says she \u201cthinks about it sometimes\u201d when tired or when family brings it up, and she can redirect her attention. She denies flashbacks or a sense of reliving the event, and she denies trauma-related nightmares; her dreams are described as nonspecific and \u201cmore about being late or messing up at work.\u201d She denies persistent hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, or sustained avoidance of reminders beyond the initial short period. She reports irritability and poor sleep but links these to low mood and shift changes rather than fear-based reactivity. She continues to work in the emergency department and does not avoid accident-related news or driving. Overall, the accident is described as distressing but not the primary focus of her current symptoms.\n\nMood/anxiety/psychosis screening: She denies past periods of abnormally elevated or expansive mood, decreased need for sleep with high energy, pressured speech, racing thoughts, increased goal-directed activity, impulsive spending, or other episodes suggestive of mania/hypomania. She denies hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia. She reports some generalized worry about work performance but states the worry \u201ccomes after the sadness and exhaustion,\u201d not as a longstanding pattern.\n\nMedical/substance factors: She denies recent steroid use, stimulant use, or other medication changes. No current pregnancy or postpartum period. She reports consistent low-level alcohol use without binges; no cannabis or other substances.\n\nPsychosocial: She is married with one child (age 6). Relationship strain has increased due to her withdrawal and irritability. She has been calling out of work more frequently, feels behind financially, and has reduced communication with friends. She describes low perceived social support: \u201cI don\u2019t want to dump this on anyone.\u201d\n\nMental status examination: Appearance neat but fatigued; behavior cooperative with reduced spontaneity; speech soft and slowed; mood \u201cdown\u201d; affect constricted and tearful at times; thought process linear; thought content notable for guilt and passive death wishes without plan/intent; no psychotic content; cognition grossly intact though attention intermittently lapses; insight and judgment fair.\n\nClinical impression in narrative form: The presentation is characterized by persistent depressed mood and anhedonia with neurovegetative changes (sleep and appetite disturbance), psychomotor slowing, impaired concentration, excessive guilt/worthlessness, and passive suicidal ideation causing clinically significant occupational and interpersonal impairment, without evidence of manic/hypomanic episodes, substance-induced symptoms, or a sustained fear-based trauma syndrome.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. R is a 34-year-old married nurse who presents for evaluation of \"constant worrying that I can\u2019t shut off.\" She reports persistent anxiety and apprehensive expectation occurring most days for the past 10\u201312 months, with a noticeable escalation over the last 8 months. She describes worry as excessive relative to circumstances and spread across multiple domains: her child\u2019s safety and school performance, making a clinical error at work, finances despite stable income, her spouse\u2019s health, and \"something bad happening\" when she is not present. She states, \"Even when nothing is wrong, my brain is scanning for what could go wrong next.\" She finds it difficult to control the worry and notes she spends hours mentally rehearsing contingencies, repeatedly checking her phone for updates, and seeking reassurance from her spouse.\n\nShe endorses associated physical and cognitive symptoms on most days: restlessness/feeling keyed up (\"I\u2019m revved up like I\u2019ve had too much caffeine\"), easy fatigability after shifts, muscle tension in her neck and shoulders with frequent jaw clenching, irritability (\"I snap and then feel guilty\"), difficulty concentrating due to worry \"looping\" in the background, and sleep disturbance characterized by prolonged sleep onset and frequent nighttime awakenings to \"run through lists.\" She denies discrete panic attacks with abrupt surges of terror; instead she describes a steady, diffuse tension. Symptoms have caused clinically significant distress and impairment: she has called in sick twice due to exhaustion, spends less time socializing, and reports reduced efficiency at work due to checking and rechecking charting.\n\nWhen asked about precipitants, she reports a motor vehicle incident 8 months ago in which another car ran a red light and struck the rear side of her vehicle at low speed. Airbags did not deploy, she was not trapped, and she sustained only mild bruising; she did not require emergency care. She describes being startled by screeching tires since then and says she is \"more on edge\" while driving, especially at intersections. She occasionally has brief, unwanted recollections of the sound of the impact when approaching similar intersections, but she does not experience flashbacks, dissociative episodes, or a sense that the event is happening again. She denies recurrent distressing dreams about the incident. She continues to drive daily and does not avoid the intersection where it occurred; she reports mild anticipatory tension but states, \"I still go, I just grip the steering wheel.\" She does not report persistent emotional numbing, detachment, inability to experience positive emotions, or pervasive negative beliefs about herself or the world stemming from the incident. Her core worries remain broad and not confined to driving or the accident.\n\nShe denies suicidal or homicidal ideation, self-harm, manic/hypomanic episodes, psychotic symptoms, or obsessive intrusive thoughts with compulsive rituals beyond reassurance-seeking and checking driven by worry. Appetite is variable but weight is stable. She drinks 1\u20132 cups of coffee daily; denies stimulant use and denies increased alcohol use (rare social drinking). Medical history is notable for episodic tension headaches; no thyroid disease reported. No current medications. Family history includes a mother described as \"a lifelong worrier.\" She reports no history of physical or sexual assault and no exposure to combat.\n\nMental status exam: well-groomed, cooperative, mildly fidgety; speech normal rate/volume; mood \"anxious and tired\" with congruent affect; thought process linear with prominent ruminative content; no delusions or hallucinations; cognition grossly intact though attention subjectively impaired by worry; insight and judgment fair. She expresses motivation for treatment and asks, \"Is there a way to stop my mind from catastrophizing everything?\"",

    "clinical_text": "A 24-year-old man presents for evaluation due to long-standing difficulties with attention, organization, and restlessness that are now threatening his job performance. He reports that for as long as he can remember he has struggled to stay focused on tasks that are not immediately engaging. At work, he frequently loses track during meetings and needs to ask colleagues to repeat information. He states, \u201cI\u2019ll start listening and then my mind just takes off\u2014five minutes later I realize I didn\u2019t hear anything.\u201d He describes making avoidable mistakes on routine tickets because he skims or misses details, noting, \u201cI read the customer issue too fast, hit send, and then realize I forgot a step.\u201d\n\nHe reports significant difficulty sustaining attention on longer tasks such as writing documentation, completing required training modules, or reviewing multi-step procedures. He procrastinates and avoids tasks requiring sustained mental effort, saying, \u201cIf it\u2019s a long form or a boring training, I put it off until the last minute, and then it\u2019s a disaster.\u201d He describes poor follow-through and frequent failure to finish tasks despite understanding them: \u201cI start organizing the queue, then I bounce to something else, and by the end of the day half of it is unfinished.\u201d\n\nHe endorses chronic disorganization: his workspace is cluttered, he misses deadlines unless multiple reminders are set, and he underestimates how long tasks will take. \u201cMy calendar is full of alerts because otherwise I forget. Even then I\u2019ll dismiss the reminder and immediately get pulled into something else.\u201d He commonly misplaces items (keys, badge, earbuds) and spends time daily searching for them. He is easily distracted by external stimuli and internal thoughts: \u201cIf someone walks by or I get a notification, I\u2019m gone. Even if it\u2019s quiet, I get distracted by my own thoughts.\u201d He also reports forgetfulness in daily activities (forgetting to return messages, missing appointments, forgetting to pay bills unless automated).\n\nIn addition to attention and organization problems, he describes restlessness and impulsivity. He feels \u201cwired\u201d and has trouble remaining seated through meetings, often shifting, tapping his foot, or getting up to pace. At home he frequently starts multiple chores without finishing, and he finds it difficult to relax during leisure time: \u201cEven watching a show, I\u2019m scrolling, getting up, doing something else.\u201d He reports excessive talking in conversations and interrupting others: \u201cI cut people off and answer before they finish. I don\u2019t mean to\u2014it just comes out.\u201d He also describes impatience, especially in lines or slow-moving situations, and a tendency to blurt out responses.\n\nHe notes that these patterns were present in childhood and caused impairment across settings. He recalls elementary school report cards repeatedly stating that he was bright but \u201cdoesn\u2019t apply himself,\u201d \u201cdaydreams,\u201d and \u201cforgets homework.\u201d He describes frequent careless mistakes, losing assignments, and needing parents to manage his backpack and school materials. Teachers often moved his seat due to distractibility and talking. At home, he needed repeated prompts to complete chores and would forget instructions unless given one step at a time. He reports that symptoms were evident well before middle school and continued through high school and college, where he relied on cramming, last-minute work, and extensions.\n\nCurrently, symptoms cause clinically significant impairment: he has received a formal performance warning for missed deadlines and documentation errors, and he worries about job loss. Interpersonally, his roommate complains that he forgets shared responsibilities and leaves tasks half-done. He reports feeling frustrated and embarrassed by these difficulties and says, \u201cI\u2019m trying harder than everyone thinks, but it\u2019s like my brain won\u2019t cooperate.\u201d\n\nHe denies episodes of elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, or other symptoms suggestive of a manic or hypomanic episode. He denies persistent depressed mood, anhedonia, or suicidal ideation. He denies hallucinations or delusional beliefs. He reports typical sleep of 7\u20138 hours, though he stays up late when procrastinating and then struggles in the morning. He denies significant anxiety symptoms driving inattention (e.g., pervasive worry), though he feels situational stress about work consequences. He denies substance misuse and reports stable caffeine intake (1\u20132 coffees/day). No history of head injury, seizures, or thyroid disease is reported. There is a family history of similar lifelong distractibility in his father (not formally evaluated).\n\nOverall, the presentation is characterized by persistent problems with attention, organization, distractibility, forgetfulness, restlessness, and impulsive conversational style beginning in childhood, occurring across school/work and home settings, and resulting in significant functional impairment.",

    "clinical_text": "34-year-old emergency department nurse presents for evaluation due to persistent sleep disturbance, anxiety, and mood changes that began after a violent incident at work 9 months ago. She reports that while restraining an agitated patient in the ED, she was punched repeatedly in the face and neck and briefly pinned to the floor; she believed she might be killed when the patient reached toward her waistband. She required medical evaluation for contusions but no fractures. Since that event, she describes recurrent, intrusive, unwanted memories that \u201chit me out of nowhere\u2014like I\u2019m right back on that floor.\u201d She reports nightmares 2\u20133 nights per week with themes of being trapped and unable to call for help. She endorses occasional episodes at work in which a yelling patient or the sound of a bed alarm triggers a brief sense of reliving the assault with tunnel vision and a surge of panic; she states, \u201cFor a few seconds I\u2019m not in the room anymore.\u201d She becomes visibly distressed when describing walking past the specific trauma bay and reports strong physiologic reactions to reminders (palpitations, sweating, nausea).\n\nShe has made marked efforts to avoid reminders: she requests assignment away from the trauma bay, avoids watching medical dramas or news stories about hospital violence, and refuses to discuss the event with colleagues or family. She says, \u201cIf I start thinking about it, I can\u2019t shut it off, so I just push it down.\u201d She reports persistent negative beliefs since the incident: \u201cNow I think people are dangerous,\u201d and \u201cI should\u2019ve handled it better.\u201d She endorses self-blame for not anticipating the assault and describes ongoing fear, anger, and shame. She reports feeling detached from coworkers and family, stating, \u201cI\u2019m there, but I\u2019m not really there,\u201d and she notices a reduced capacity to feel warmth or joy, especially at work. She still experiences moments of enjoyment when she is off-duty and in predictable settings (e.g., cooking with her child, short walks with her spouse), but she describes these as \u201cmuted\u201d compared with before.\n\nShe also reports increased irritability and a \u201cshort fuse,\u201d particularly when startled or approached from behind. She is hypervigilant in public spaces and at work, repeatedly scanning entrances and positioning herself near exits; she avoids elevators if crowded. She describes an exaggerated startle response to loud noises (monitor alarms, dropped objects). Concentration has worsened during charting, especially after exposure to triggering situations. Sleep is fragmented with prolonged sleep-onset latency due to \u201crunning the scene in my head,\u201d and she often wakes after nightmares.\n\nShe endorses feeling \u201cdown\u201d and discouraged at times because her symptoms have persisted and because she worries she is \u201cnot the nurse I used to be.\u201d However, she denies a sustained period of depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day for at least two weeks. She denies pervasive loss of interest across all activities; she continues to look forward to planned family activities on days off, though she avoids busy public venues. Appetite is stable without significant weight change. She denies psychomotor slowing or agitation outside of trauma-triggered anxiety. She denies persistent feelings of worthlessness unrelated to the incident; her guilt is focused on perceived mistakes during the assault. She denies suicidal ideation, intent, or plan, stating, \u201cI just want this to stop\u2014I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d No history of manic or hypomanic episodes is reported.\n\nSymptoms have been present for 9 months and cause clinically significant impairment: she has reduced her work hours, avoids certain assignments, and has received feedback about decreased confidence during acute situations. Relationship strain is noted due to emotional distancing and irritability. She denies current intoxication or withdrawal symptoms, denies increased alcohol use (reports 1\u20132 drinks/month), and denies stimulant or sedative misuse. Medical review is unremarkable aside from residual neck tension; she denies recent head injury, seizures, or endocrine symptoms. Mental status exam: alert and oriented; mood described as \u201con edge and tired\u201d; affect constricted but reactive when discussing her child; thought process linear; no delusions or hallucinations; no current suicidal or homicidal ideation; insight and judgment fair. She requests help \u201csleeping without reliving it\u201d and \u201cnot panicking every time someone yells.\u201d",

He attends with his mother, who provides developmental history.\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient reports he \u201cdoes fine when the tasks are clear,\u201d but becomes overwhelmed during unstructured social situations at work (break room, team meetings). He says, \u201cI never know when I\u2019m supposed to talk. People think I\u2019m ignoring them.\u201d Coworkers have complained that he appears \u201cblunt\u201d and \u201crude,\u201d though he denies intent to offend: \u201cIf someone asks a question, I answer it. I don\u2019t see the point of small talk.\u201d He has difficulty initiating or sustaining back-and-forth conversation unless the topic is his area of interest (public transit maps and timetables). During the interview, he provides extensive monologues about route numbers and historical schedule changes, with limited awareness of the interviewer\u2019s cues to shift topics.\n\nSocial communication and interaction: The patient describes limited friendships and minimal interest in socializing beyond a single online forum about trains. He reports he has never had a romantic relationship and states, \u201cDating feels like guessing the rules of a game.\u201d He struggles to interpret others\u2019 facial expressions and tone; he often takes statements literally and misses sarcasm. His mother notes that since childhood he rarely shared enjoyment spontaneously (e.g., would line up toys rather than show them) and did not consistently respond to his name unless approached directly. In the session, eye contact is reduced and intermittent; facial expressions are relatively flat and do not consistently match the emotional content of his speech. Gestures are limited; he has difficulty coordinating verbal responses with nonverbal signals, and he does not readily ask reciprocal questions.\n\nRestricted/repetitive behaviors and interests: He demonstrates a strong preference for sameness and becomes distressed with changes in routine. He reports, \u201cIf my shift starts 30 minutes later than usual, my whole day is ruined,\u201d and describes a recent episode of significant agitation when the bus route he uses was detoured: he paced, raised his voice, and had to leave the stop because he felt \u201cout of control.\u201d He follows highly structured daily rituals (same breakfast, same route to work, same order of tasks) and becomes anxious if prevented from completing them. He exhibits repetitive motor mannerisms, intermittently rocking in his chair and rubbing his fingertips together during the interview, which he reports helps him \u201cstay calm.\u201d His interests are unusually intense and circumscribed; he spends several hours daily cataloging transit data and can recall detailed schedules from years prior. He also reports sensory sensitivities: he finds fluorescent lights \u201cpainful,\u201d is distressed by certain fabric textures, and wears noise-reducing headphones in stores due to \u201csharp\u201d sounds. His mother reports that as a child he was very selective about clothing textures and covered his ears with everyday noises (vacuum, blender).\n\nDevelopmental history: His mother reports that differences were evident early. He spoke his first words around age 2 and began using phrases later than peers. As a preschooler, he preferred solitary play, repeatedly lined up toy vehicles, and became upset if others moved them. He had difficulty with imaginative play and tended to repeat lines from favorite videos. In elementary school, teachers noted he was academically strong in factual subjects but struggled with group work and peer relationships; he was described as \u201cin his own world.\u201d There is no history suggesting a period of normal early development followed by regression.\n\nFunctional impact: Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in occupational and social functioning. He can perform structured tasks well but has repeated conflicts related to communication style, difficulty adapting to changes, and sensory overload. Socially, he remains largely isolated and relies on parents for support with appointments and navigating new situations.\n\nMental status examination: Appearance is neat and appropriate. Behavior is cooperative but somewhat rigid; he becomes mildly anxious when the interview deviates from his expected format, asking, \u201cWhat question is next?\u201d Speech is fluent but pedantic and overly detailed; prosody is somewhat monotone. Mood is \u201cfine,\u201d affect constricted. Thought process is generally logical but tangential around preferred topics. No delusions or hallucinations. Cognition grossly intact; he demonstrates strong rote memory. Insight is partial (recognizes difficulties but attributes them primarily to others \u201cnot being clear\u201d).\n\nDifferential considerations: There is no evidence of psychosis or mania. He denies substance use. While he experiences anxiety in response to change and social uncertainty, the pattern of early-onset social-communication differences alongside repetitive behaviors, rigidity, circumscribed interests, and sensory sensitivities across contexts is prominent. There is no indication that global intellectual impairment better explains the presentation; academic history and observed cognition suggest at least average intellectual functioning, with uneven social-communication skills.\n\nOverall, the presentation reflects a lifelong pattern beginning in early development characterized by persistent difficulties in social reciprocity, nonverbal communication, and relationship development, along with restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, insistence on sameness, highly fixated interests, and sensory sensitivities, resulting in significant functional impairment.",

    "clinical_text": "Chief concern: \u201cI can\u2019t keep it together at work, and lately I just feel empty and tired all the time.\u201d\n\nHistory of present illness: The patient presents for evaluation after receiving a second performance warning for missed deadlines and errors in client deliverables. She reports a long-standing pattern of being \u201cscattered,\u201d losing track of tasks, and underestimating how long work will take. She describes frequent difficulty sustaining attention in meetings (\u201cI drift off after a few minutes and then panic because I missed key details\u201d), making careless mistakes when preparing reports, and needing to re-read emails multiple times. She often starts tasks but does not finish them unless there is an immediate deadline, and she struggles to organize multi-step projects (\u201cMy to-do list becomes a graveyard\u201d). She misplaces items daily (phone, badge, keys), is easily distracted by unrelated thoughts or notifications, and forgets appointments unless her partner reminds her or she sets multiple alarms.\n\nShe also endorses chronic restlessness since childhood: she fidgets constantly, taps her foot, and feels \u201cdriven by a motor\u201d during the workday, pacing while on phone calls and interrupting others when she worries she\u2019ll forget what she wants to say. She reports she often blurts out answers in meetings and finishes coworkers\u2019 sentences. She describes impatience in lines and traffic and difficulty waiting her turn. These symptoms occur at work and at home, where her partner complains she \u201cdoesn\u2019t listen,\u201d leaves household tasks half-done, and starts multiple chores without completing them.\n\nDevelopmental/school history: She recalls similar difficulties beginning in elementary school. She reports teachers frequently wrote comments such as \u201cbright but not working to potential,\u201d \u201ctalks in class,\u201d \u201cdaydreams,\u201d and \u201cmissing homework.\u201d Her mother (contacted with patient permission) corroborates that as a child she was \u201calways on the go,\u201d often forgot to bring home assignments, and needed repeated prompting to complete routines. The patient reports she never received formal evaluation in childhood, and she compensated in high school with last-minute cramming and help from friends, but continued to have chronic disorganization.\n\nMood symptoms: Over the past 6\u20137 weeks, she has experienced a persistent low mood most of the day nearly every day, describing it as \u201cheavy\u201d and \u201cflat.\u201d She reports markedly reduced interest in activities she previously enjoyed (running, cooking, seeing friends), stating, \u201cI don\u2019t care about anything; I just want to lie there.\u201d She endorses fatigue nearly every day and says she feels \u201cexhausted even after doing nothing.\u201d Sleep has been disrupted with early morning awakening and difficulty returning to sleep 4\u20135 nights per week. Appetite is decreased with an unintentional 8-pound weight loss over the past month. She reports feeling worthless and excessively self-critical (\u201cI\u2019m a screw-up; everyone would be better off without me\u201d), with frequent guilt about letting her team and partner down. Concentration has worsened further than her baseline, making it harder to initiate tasks and increasing avoidance of emails and bills. She has had recurrent passive thoughts of death (\u201cIf I didn\u2019t wake up, it would be a relief\u201d) and fleeting thoughts of \u201cnot wanting to be here,\u201d but denies a specific plan or intent; she agrees to reach out to her partner and crisis resources if these thoughts intensify.\n\nCourse and interaction of symptoms: She distinguishes her long-term attentional and organizational difficulties from the recent mood change, noting she has \u201calways been distractible,\u201d but the last several weeks have added pervasive sadness, loss of pleasure, low energy, and hopelessness that further reduce her ability to start and complete tasks. She reports that work failures related to distractibility and missed details have contributed to feelings of shame and demoralization, which then worsen procrastination and withdrawal.\n\nSubstances/medical: She drinks alcohol 1\u20132 drinks on weekends, denies binge drinking, and denies cannabis or other illicit substances. She consumes 2\u20133 coffees daily and sometimes uses energy drinks when behind on work. No history of head injury, seizures, thyroid disease, or chronic pain. Current medications: none.\n\nMania/psychosis screening: She denies any past episodes of persistently elevated or expansive mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, pressured speech, inflated self-esteem, or risky behavior. She denies hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia.\n\nFunctioning/impairment: Work performance has declined with missed deadlines, disorganization, and increased errors. At home, she is behind on bills, laundry, and chores, and her relationship is strained by forgetfulness and irritability. She has been socially withdrawn for over a month and has stopped exercising.\n\nFamily history: Father described as \u201crestless\u201d with chronic job changes and impulsive spending; no formal diagnoses known. Maternal aunt with recurrent depressive episodes.\n\nSafety: Passive suicidal ideation without plan or intent; protective factors include strong relationship with partner, desire not to harm family, and willingness to seek help. No firearms in the home per patient report.",

    "clinical_text": "Ms. R is a 28-year-old marketing coordinator presenting for evaluation due to longstanding difficulties with attention and organization that have worsened in the context of a recent several-week period of pervasive low mood and loss of interest. She reports that since elementary school she has struggled to sustain attention in class, frequently \u201czoned out,\u201d and needed repeated redirection. She recalls incomplete homework despite understanding the material, losing worksheets and books, and being described by teachers as \u201cbright but doesn\u2019t apply herself.\u201d At home, she was often reprimanded for not following through on chores, leaving tasks half-done, and misplacing items (keys, school supplies). She states these patterns continued through high school and college: she would start assignments late, underestimate time, pull all-nighters, and rely on last-minute pressure to finish. She describes chronic difficulty organizing multi-step tasks, keeping track of deadlines, and maintaining an orderly workspace. At work, she reports frequent errors due to missing details, forgetting meeting times unless reminded, and difficulty staying engaged during long meetings: \u201cI try so hard to listen, but my mind jumps to something else and I realize I missed a whole section.\u201d She also describes being easily distracted by emails, office conversations, and phone notifications, and frequently shifting between tasks without completing them.\n\nShe endorses persistent forgetfulness in daily activities (missing bill payments, forgetting to return calls, leaving the stove on once) and routinely misplacing items (badge, phone, earbuds) several times per week. She reports avoidance of tasks requiring sustained mental effort, such as writing reports and budgeting, stating, \u201cI feel dread because I know I\u2019ll lose focus.\u201d She notes that these attention/organization problems have been present across settings (school, home, and work), began well before adolescence, and have caused functional impairment, including multiple performance warnings at work and chronic academic stress earlier in life.\n\nIn addition, she describes a 6-week period of depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day. She states, \u201cI wake up heavy and sad, like there\u2019s no point,\u201d and reports markedly diminished interest in previously enjoyable activities (stopped going to the gym, no longer socializing on weekends, and has not worked on a hobby she previously enjoyed). She reports reduced appetite with an unintentional 6-pound weight loss over the past month, as well as insomnia characterized by early-morning awakening and difficulty returning to sleep. She describes low energy and fatigue: \u201cEven showering feels like a chore.\u201d Coworkers have commented she seems slowed down and quieter; she also reports occasional restlessness, pacing at night while ruminating.\n\nShe endorses feelings of worthlessness and excessive self-criticism, stating, \u201cI\u2019m failing at being an adult,\u201d and reports excessive guilt about underperforming at work and withdrawing from friends. Concentration has worsened beyond her baseline, with increased difficulty making decisions and completing even short tasks, which she experiences as \u201cbrain fog.\u201d She acknowledges recurrent passive thoughts of death over the past two weeks (\u201cSometimes I think it would be easier not to wake up\u201d), but denies intent or plan, denies past suicide attempts, and identifies protective factors including close relationship with her sister and fear of harming her family. She denies any history of periods of elevated or expansive mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, grandiosity, or impulsive high-risk behavior. She denies hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia.\n\nShe reports that the recent mood decline has amplified her longstanding organizational difficulties: missed deadlines have increased, which then intensifies self-blame and withdrawal. She notes increased absenteeism (two sick days in the past month) and reduced productivity. She denies a recent bereavement or other single triggering event, though she notes cumulative stress from work demands. She is not taking any psychoactive medications. She denies stimulant use outside of caffeine and drinks 2\u20133 cups of coffee daily. Physical review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.\n\nMental status examination: appropriately groomed, cooperative, speech normal rate/volume, mood \u201csad,\u201d affect constricted, thought process linear but occasionally tangential when describing multiple concerns. No psychotic content. Cognition grossly intact; attention during the interview fluctuates, with frequent need to ask for repetition of complex questions. Insight and judgment fair. Safety: passive suicidal ideation without plan or intent; agrees to safety planning and crisis resources.",

    "clinical_text": "The patient presents for evaluation after progressive functional decline over the past 5\u20136 months, with a marked worsening in the last 7\u20138 weeks. She reports that 9 months ago she was involved in a multi-vehicle collision while driving home from work in heavy rain. She describes being trapped in the car with smoke and the smell of gasoline while hearing \"people screaming\" and seeing another driver \"not moving\" until first responders extricated her. She sustained minor physical injuries but recalls intense fear and helplessness. Since then, she endorses recurrent, involuntary memories that \"hit me out of nowhere\" when she hears screeching brakes or smells burning rubber. She has distressing dreams 3\u20134 nights/week in which she is \"back in the car\" and wakes \"soaked in sweat\" with her heart racing. She describes intermittent episodes while driving where she feels as if the crash is happening again\u2014\"for a second I\u2019m not in the present\"\u2014and she grips the wheel so hard her hands cramp. Exposure to reminders (sirens, rain at night, intersections near the accident site) triggers intense psychological distress and physiological symptoms (palpitations, shaking, nausea).\n\nShe reports persistent avoidance since the accident: she will not drive on highways, refuses to ride as a passenger with others, and takes a longer route to work to avoid the intersection where the crash occurred. She avoids watching news or videos involving accidents and changes the topic when coworkers discuss recent traumas in the emergency department. She states, \"If I think about it, I start spiraling, so I push it away.\" Despite avoidance, she describes a persistent negative emotional state (fear, shame, anger) and pervasive self-blame: \"If I\u2019d left five minutes later, that person might be alive.\" She acknowledges she does not know whether the other driver died, but she feels \"responsible anyway\" and repeatedly replays \"what I should have done.\" She reports diminished interest in previously enjoyed activities (running, cooking, visiting friends), describing herself as \"numb\" and \"just going through motions.\" She feels detached from others: \"I\u2019m there at work, but I feel behind glass.\" She has difficulty experiencing positive emotions\u2014\"Even when something good happens, I can\u2019t feel it.\" She also reports problems recalling some details of the accident, stating, \"There are gaps\u2014I don\u2019t remember how I got out of the car.\" \n\nIn addition, over the last 7\u20138 weeks she endorses a near-daily depressed mood most of the day: \"I wake up and it\u2019s like a heavy coat I can\u2019t take off.\" She reports markedly reduced pleasure in nearly all activities, including music and time with her sister. She notes decreased appetite with unintended weight loss of about 10 pounds in two months and reports low energy and fatigue: \"I feel drained by noon even if I\u2019ve done nothing.\" Sleep is disrupted: she has difficulty falling asleep due to fear of nightmares, wakes frequently, and sometimes sleeps in short daytime stretches due to night shifts but states her sleep is \"never restful.\" She reports impaired concentration and indecisiveness, making medication calculations at work feel harder, and she double-checks excessively because she is afraid of making a mistake. She describes psychomotor changes noticed by others: coworkers have commented she seems \"slowed down\" and \"quiet,\" while at home she paces and wrings her hands when keyed up by reminders. She reports excessive guilt and feelings of worthlessness: \"I\u2019m a burden. I\u2019m not the person I used to be.\" She denies past manic or hypomanic episodes.\n\nShe endorses recurrent thoughts of death over the past month and intermittent passive suicidal ideation, stating, \"Sometimes I think it would be easier not to wake up.\" Two weeks ago, after a nightmare and an argument with her ex-spouse, she briefly thought about \"taking a whole bottle\" of leftover pain medication but did not gather pills or write a note; she reports the thought frightened her and she called her sister instead. She denies current intent or plan during the interview, states she does not own firearms, and agrees to remove remaining medications from her home with her sister\u2019s help.\n\nShe also describes persistent hyperarousal symptoms since the accident: irritability with \"snapping\" at coworkers, exaggerated startle response to loud noises, hypervigilance in parking lots (\"I scan every car\"), and difficulty relaxing. She reports that driving at night leads to intense tension and she sometimes pulls over to calm down. Symptoms have been present for many months, occur across settings, and cause clinically significant impairment: she has used sick days, requested fewer shifts, avoids social outings due to fear of travel, and her work performance has suffered. She reports that the depressive symptoms feel intertwined with her post-accident anxiety: \"I\u2019m exhausted from being on guard all the time, and then I hate myself for not functioning.\" She denies current alcohol or drug misuse and denies psychotic symptoms.\n\nMental status exam (summary): alert and oriented; grooming adequate but appears tired; speech soft and slowed; mood described as \"empty\" with constricted affect; thought process linear but ruminative; thought content notable for guilt and trauma-related intrusions; no hallucinations or delusions elicited; insight fair; judgment intact in session. Risk assessment: passive suicidal ideation without current plan or intent, protective factors include relationship with sister and commitment to patients; safety planning initiated.",

She describes feeling \"frozen\" and \"sure I was going to die too\" when gunfire continued nearby. Since the event, she experiences recurrent, involuntary memories of the scene that \"come out of nowhere\" several times per week, often triggered by sirens, the smell of blood/antiseptic, or crowded public spaces.

She has stopped attending large gatherings and no longer goes to the gym during busy hours because \"I need to know where every exit is.\" She reports persistent negative beliefs since the incident: \"The world is unsafe,\" and \"If I relax, something bad will happen.\" She endorses intense self-blame about her coworker\u2019s death\u2014\"I should have done more, I keep replaying what I missed\"\u2014despite acknowledging she followed protocol. She describes chronic feelings of fear, guilt, and anger, with reduced capacity to experience positive emotions: \"Even when something good happens, it doesn\u2019t land.\" She feels detached from her partner and friends, saying she is \"watching life from behind glass\" and has become socially withdrawn.\n\nOver the past 7\u20138 weeks, her symptoms have worsened with pervasive low mood most of the day nearly every day. She reports marked loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities (running, cooking, and spending time with friends). She notes decreased appetite with unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds over two months. Sleep is fragmented; she has difficulty falling asleep due to scanning the apartment and repeatedly checking door locks, and she wakes early after nightmares, then cannot return to sleep. She reports persistent fatigue and low energy, stating, \"I\u2019m exhausted all the time, like I\u2019m moving through mud.\" Concentration has declined\u2014she rereads the same charting repeatedly and makes minor documentation errors at work, which is new for her. She describes feelings of worthlessness and excessive guilt that extend beyond the traumatic event: \"I\u2019m failing at everything\u2014work, my relationship, being a decent person.\" Her partner reports she has become more irritable and \"snaps\" over small issues; the patient acknowledges increased anger and impatience and says she is \"on edge\" and easily startled by sudden noises.\n\nShe endorses passive thoughts of death occurring several times in the last month: \"Sometimes I think it would be easier if I just didn\u2019t wake up.\" She denies a specific plan or intent and denies preparatory behaviors. She identifies protective factors including her partner, responsibility to her EMS team, and not wanting her family to experience loss. She agrees to seek help and to use crisis resources if suicidal thoughts intensify.\n\nFunctionally, she has used increased sick days, has requested fewer high-acuity calls, and has received feedback about decreased focus. At home, she avoids intimacy, spends more time alone, and has stopped responding to friends\u2019 messages. She denies hallucinations, delusions, or panic attacks unrelated to trauma cues. She denies periods of abnormally elevated mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, grandiosity, pressured speech, or risky spending. She denies recent substance escalation. Basic labs obtained by primary care (CBC, CMP, TSH) were reportedly normal, and there is no evidence that symptoms are attributable to a medical condition or substances.\n\nMental status exam: Appears stated age, mildly disheveled, fatigued. Behavior guarded but cooperative. Speech normal rate/volume. Mood \"down and anxious\"; affect constricted, tearful when recounting the event. Thought process linear; thought content notable for guilt and negative beliefs about safety; no psychosis. Cognition grossly intact though attention fluctuates. Insight and judgment fair. Suicidal ideation passive without plan/intent; denies homicidal ideation.\n\nOverall presentation reflects persistent trauma-related re-experiencing with avoidance, negative mood/cognitions, and hyperarousal lasting >1 month with significant social and occupational impairment, along with a sustained period of depressed mood and loss of interest accompanied by neurovegetative and cognitive symptoms and passive suicidal ideation.",

No significant medical history; recent primary care evaluation reportedly normal (including thyroid screening).

    "clinical_text": "32-year-old teacher presents for outpatient evaluation due to persistent anxiety and recent worsening mood. She reports that for approximately 9 months she has experienced excessive and hard-to-control worry occurring most days, spanning multiple areas (job performance, finances, parents\u2019 health, and \u201csomething going wrong\u201d during her commute). She states, \u201cMy brain doesn\u2019t stop scanning for problems,\u201d and \u201cEven when nothing is happening, I\u2019m bracing for bad news.\u201d She describes difficulty controlling the worry, noting that reassurance provides only brief relief before she begins worrying about something else.\n\nAssociated symptoms over the same 9-month period include feeling keyed up/on edge (\u201cI\u2019m tense all the time\u201d), muscle tension in her neck/shoulders with frequent headaches, irritability (\u201cI snap at my husband over small things\u201d), fatigue (\u201cI feel worn out by noon\u201d), difficulty concentrating (\u201cI reread emails three times and still miss details\u201d), and sleep disturbance. Sleep is described as both trouble falling asleep due to ruminative thoughts and frequent early-morning awakenings. She reports functional impact: increased time spent checking lesson plans repeatedly, avoiding taking on new responsibilities, and reduced social engagement because she feels \u201ctoo anxious to be good company.\u201d\n\nOver the past 6 weeks, she reports a distinct downturn in mood nearly every day, most of the day, with tearfulness and a sense of hopelessness. She says, \u201cI feel heavy and empty,\u201d and \u201cNothing feels worth the effort.\u201d She also endorses markedly diminished interest/pleasure in previously enjoyed activities such as running and meeting friends (\u201cI keep canceling; even when I go, I don\u2019t enjoy it\u201d). She reports decreased appetite with an unintentional weight loss of about 6 pounds in the last month. Sleep has worsened with early-morning awakening and nonrestorative sleep. She endorses low energy nearly daily, psychomotor slowing noted by her spouse (\u201cHe says I move like I\u2019m in slow motion\u201d), diminished ability to think or concentrate at work (making more mistakes, taking longer to complete grading), and feelings of worthlessness/excessive guilt (\u201cI\u2019m letting my students down; I\u2019m a bad partner; I can\u2019t do anything right\u201d).\n\nShe reports recurrent thoughts that she would be \u201cbetter off not waking up,\u201d occurring several times per week over the last month, but denies any current plan, intent, preparatory behaviors, or prior attempts. She denies homicidal thoughts. She denies any past periods of abnormally elevated or expansive mood, decreased need for sleep with increased energy, pressured speech, inflated self-esteem, or risky behavior. She denies hallucinations, paranoia, or other psychotic symptoms.\n\nShe reports that the ongoing worry and tension preceded the current low mood; she feels the constant worrying \u201cwore me down,\u201d and the recent depressed mood has further reduced her coping, leading to more avoidance and increased rumination. She denies that symptoms are attributable to medication, substances, or an acute medical condition. Overall, the symptoms are causing clinically significant distress and impairment in occupational performance, relationships, and self-care.",
